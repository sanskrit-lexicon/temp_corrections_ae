<H>Foreword
<P>‘What is there in a name?’ There is definitely much more in
<>a name than may appear to be the case on a superficial survey.
<>Names may appear to be quite casual, so much so that the
<>man bearing them has hardly any say in the matter. We find
<>some people adopting new names or adding aliases. In many
<>cases the name does not have any equation with the personal
<>qualities of the man concerned. The titles assumed by a
<>man may reflect something of his inner personality, his
<>ambitions, and his emotional complexes; the epithets bes-
<>towed by others, if not created by greedy flatterers, reveal
<>his assessment in the eyes of others. Whereas the surnames
<>may often depend on the accident of birth in a given family or
<>a social group, the personal names are labelled long before
<>any of the recognisable attributes begin to emerge. The story
<>of names would have assumed a highly romantic colour if the
<>names had been assumed by people and had not been thrust
<>upon them.
<P>The names may not reveal the man, but they do provide
<>penetrating peeps into his family, his society and his times. The
<>name-patterns have a vital connexion with the social realities
<>and cultural values of the group to which they belong. There is
<>a distinct individuality in them and they reflect in a microscopic
<>miniature the traditions and values of the people concerned.
<>Poeple do not take to names in as casual a manner as they are
<>sometimes taken to do. Of all the people the Indians seem to
<>show a much serious concern for the question of names and to
<>have set down definite rules governing their formation. These
<>rules are not mere grammatical ones to cover the linguistic
<>forms of the names. There are prescriptive norms and prohibi-
<>tive rules in accordance with the socio-cultural traditions and the
<>advancements made in various fields of knowledge. Not many
[Pagetitle-viii+ 39]
<>nations of antiquity can claim a parallel progress in this area
<>of culture. These elaborate rules did not result merely from
<>the typically Indian genius for systematisation and elaboration
<>of its fund of knowledge in all spheres. It arose out of a cons-
<>cious appreciation of the significance of names and their great
<>relevance for the cultural traditions. The rules about names
<>prescribed in the grammatical works and the Gṛhyasūtras and
<>the Smṛtis were elaborated in subsequent times and led to the
<>composition of separate treatises on various aspects and
<>problems connected with the giving of names.
<P>The names can provide a reliable clue to the understanding
<>of the socio-cultural life. They can serve as a barometer for
<>recording the historical realities of culture in a particular period.
<>A study of the name-patterns can be a useful measuring rod
<>for a historian; but, it has been rarely used. A name can reveal
<>the personal equipment of the bestowing parents and also their
<>emotional concern for their child. Above all, it tells us about
<>the gods and goddesses and their comparative popularity, the
<>religious ideas and beliefs current among the people, the social
<>structure and the differences in the various social groups, and
<>the realities of the linguistic phenomenon. In view of the
<>elaborate rules about the grammatical, astronomical, religious
<>and social considerations, an analysis of the pattern of names
<>in different historical periods can give us a vital indication of
<>the extent to which the traditional rules were respected and of
<>the influences which were introducing changes in the traditional
<>beliefs and systems.
<P>Considering the rich possibilities in a historical and com-
<>parative analysis of the name-patterns, it is surprising indeed
<>that, with a few singular exceptions, historians have not paid
<>to this area of study the serious attention it deserves. Obviously
<>this type of study is more demanding in respect of the discip-
<>lines involved. The historian, who undertakes the work, has to
<>possess a comprehensive knowledge of different aspects of an
<>ancient society. He has to combine a knowledge of Sanskrit
<>grammar and linguistics with a proficiency in palaeography and
<>competence to handle the original texts bearing on the subject.
<>Happily Dr. Tej Ram Sharma, one of my early research
<>scholars, assiduously cultivated the qualities and acquired the
[Pagetitle-ix+ 23]
<>necessary command over the concerned disciplines. It is gratify-
<>ing to find that Dr. Sharma has produced a first-rate study on
<>the subject and has covered himself up with glory.
<P>The study of the Gupta period of Indian history has been
<>enriched by the contributions of many a competent scholar.
<>But, without there being any significant addition to the original
<>sources, some of the many publications have only been
<>reproducing already well-known material. The approach
<>adopted in these studies being regularly repetitive has acquired
<>a chilling monotonousness. Dr. Sharma deserves commenda-
<>tion for attempting an analysis of the culture of the Gupta
<>period from an altogether new angle. His fresh approach
<>has imparted a living warmth to the socio-cultural life of
<>the period. Dr. Sharma has definitely made signficant improve-
<>ment upon our understanding of the Classical Age of Indian
<>history.
<P>In introducing the present study to the world of scholars I
<>must express my fervent desire and sincere hope that the pre-
<>sent publication will be followed by many other scholarly
<>studies by Dr. Sharma.

<H>Preface
<P>It may be pointed out at the outset that the inscriptions
<>included in the list could not be arranged in chronological order
<>as they were included during the work as and when noticed
<>and found available. We did not like to disturb the order as
<>arranged by J. F. Fleet in his {%Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum,%}
<>Vol. III and further added to the list the other inscriptions which
<>he could not include in his work due to their non-availability and
<>non-publication at the time when he published his work. The
<>criterion for the selection of the inscriptions and the seals has
<>been the relevance with the Gupta history and the area suppo-
<>sed to be under the direct rule of the Guptas.
<P>The present work, to some extent, is a break-away from
<>the traditional type of research. This work follows the lines set
<>in by F.T. Wainright and Dr. H.D. Sankalia in their works
<>{%Archaeology and place-names and History%} and {%Studies in%}
<>{%the Historical and Cultural Geography and Ethnography of%}
<>{%Gujarat%} respectively.
<P>Some people may ward off the idea in a name by saying
<>merely “what is in a name?” But we find even now the people
<>taking time to give a name to their child. They may even
<>sometime talk about the justification of the name by the child
<>which is expressed by a Sanskrit dictum {%yathā nāma tathā%}
<>{%guṇaḥ.%}
<P>A person is identified by his name by the family members
<>as well as by others. Man lives with his name in this life and
<>even after death the name survives. There is a taboo about
<>the secret name not to be disclosed or made known to others
<>for fear of sorcery or black-magic or ill-effect by the spirits.
<P>It may also be mentioned that some people may give the
<>names to their children quite thoughtfully — it may be after a
<>god, a hero, a character from some fiction, while others may
[Pagetitle-xiv+ 39]
<>imitate them without knowing or understanding any meaning or
<>thought pregnant in the names.
<P>It may be argued whether the names are connotative or not
<>but who can refuse their cultural significance or their bearing
<>on the cultural life of society. The bulk of a particular type of
<>names may signify the preponderance of certain customs or
<>predominance of some cults and traits in a society. We are
<>primarily concerned with this factor in our study on the per-
<>sonal names in the Gupta inscriptions.
<P>In the study of the geographical names we are not only
<>concerned with their identification but also with their origin,
<>cultural significance as well as the linguistic changes. The
<>geographical names may represent the important personages,
<>social beliefs in a society and its cultural habitat. The present
<>work aims at the following objectives.
<P>(i) To ascertain the historical facts proved by other evidence;
<P>(ii) To correctly check up certain disputed readings in the
<>inscriptions;
<P>(iii) To correctly interpret some disputed passages in the
<>inscriptions;
<P>(iv) To accord a scientific tinge to already known material on
<>the tribes as well as the place-names in the light of the
<>new material published through a number of monographs
<>on the subject.
<P>The works on personal names are very few. In India a work
<>of the type of {%Your Baby's name%} by Maxwell Nurnberg and
<>Morris Rosenblum, has yet to be carried out, where the original
<>history of English names has been worked out, statis-
<>tics are given of its use by estimated number of people and
<>ranked accordingly and the connotations given along with the
<>citations from literature. The names for the boys and girls
<>have also been classified separately.
<P>The present study, originally a doctoral thesis accepted by
<>the Banaras Hindu University in 1968, seeks to discuss separa-
<>tely different name-patterns with regard to personal names,
<>names of tribes, places, rivers and mountains, though in a modest
<>way. I owe special gratitude to Dr. V.S. Pathak of the Gorakhpur
<>University and Dr. L. Gopal of the Banaras Hindu University,
<>who helped me through this work. I feel highly obliged to
[Pagetitle-xv+ 21]
<>Dr. L. Gopal for writing a Foreword to this book. The award of
<>a Research Fellowship by the University Grants Commission,
<>New Delhi which enabled me to complete the dissertation, is
<>very gratefully acknowledged.
<P>Other scholars who helped me by way of valuable sugges-
<>tions are:
<P>Dr. A.K. Narain, Dr. H.D. Sankalia, Dr. D.C. Sircar,
<>Dr. G.C. Pande, Dr. Romila Thapar, Dr. A.M. Ghatage,
<>Dr. M.A. Mahendale, Dr. Mantrini Prasad, Dr. Parmanand
<>Gupta, and Prof. N. K.S. Telang.
<P>The courtesy of the Archaeological Survey of India in
<>making available photographs reproduced in this book is
<>gratefully acknowledged.
<P>Lastly, but not the least, I express my sincere thanks to
<>my wife Brij and daughter Richa who gladly spared me the
<>time for giving the present shape to the work.

[Page-003+ 34]
<H>Prologue
<P>Nominal languages, such as the Greenlandish and the
<>Nauhatt, represent the earliest stage in the development of
<>linguistic structures. They consisted mostly of the object-
<>words, which denoted the objects and also action and quality.
<>In the nominal languages, object-words (names) emerged out
<>of proper names. In the early stages of a language, the first
<>words are names, and all names are primarily proper names.
<>Generic names, like man, animal and tree, evolve later and
<>abstractions, like courage, ferocity, and greenness, later still.<sup>1</sup>
<>A proper name is a symbol pointing to one and only one
<>person, or place. Primitive man felt that the relationship
<>between name and thing was close and intimate. This fraction
<>formed the basis for rituals pertaining to propitiation and
<>incantation. The mishandling of a name in speech might imply
<>insult or may result in injury to the bearer of the name.<sup>2</sup>
<P>Even in regard to generic names we have to keep certain
<>limitations in view. Yāska states that we find convenience in
<>restricting the use of words otherwise they may bring about
<>confusion.<sup>3</sup>
<P>A personal name consists of a surname and that part of
<>name which is variously called as the first name or the Christian
<>name. Surname consists of the Caste-suffix or Gotra, Pravara
<>and Śākhā. Sometimes it may consist of Gotra or family
<>appellation alone. Many surnames are derived from the
<>principal professions the people followed or the crafts they
<>practised, and in the majority of cases, are still engaged in.
<>Some surnames give clue to the original habitat of a people,
<>even though they have migrated elsewhere. Others point to
<>the ethnic groups a people belonged. Thus surnames are
<>important from Historical, Cultural, and Ethnological point of
<>view.
<P>First names are primarily devised to denote<sup>4</sup> and not to
<>connote, though at times fortuitously denotation may be
[Page-004+ 38]
<>identical with connotation.<sup>5</sup> Nevertheless, they reflect beliefs,
<>aspirations, cultural atmosphere and level of education of
<>family, head of the family or society. It is not necessary that
<>the names befit a thing or person as soon as it is born. Some
<>names are given to them after noticing their actions. {%Bilvāda%}
<>and {%Lambacūḍaka%} were the names of certain birds current in
<>Yāska's time; Amara does not mention them. The bird {%Bilvāda%}
<>is so called on account of its habit of eating a certain fruit
<>some time after its birth. In the case of {%Lambacūḍaka%}
<>its long crest comes into existence long after its birth and
<>yet it is called {%Lambacūḍaka.%}<sup>6</sup> The first part of the names of
<>persons generally consists of certain deities, constellations,
<>abstract things or other objects of nature. They are with or
<>without a name-ending suffix.
<P>We can study personal names with respect to time, place
<>and society. A certain society will not change its naming-
<>pattern even after the change of place. From the frequency of
<>a particular name in a particular region we know of the
<>religion, culture and the philosophy of life of the people of a
<>certain region. Vidyabhushan has quoted some lengthy names
<>giving full particulars of the persons.<sup>7</sup>
<P>Now we shall briefly review the principles of naming a
<>person as prescribed by the Dharmaśāstras and grammarians.
<P>We may classify the literary data about naming into four
<>distinct periods<sup>8</sup>:
<P>1. Vedic period
<P>2. Sūtra period
<P>3. Smṛti period
<P>4. Nibandha period
<H>VEDIC PERIOD
<P>In the Vedic period usually two names were given to a
<>person, one of which was a secret name, known to the parents
<>only. Instances of persons having three or four names are also
<>found. Throughout the Vedic literature the names given to a
<>person were his own secular name and one or more other
<>names derived either from his father's or grandfather's name,
<>or from his Gotra or from a locality or from the name of his
<>mother.<sup>9</sup> It is not quite clear from the Vedic literature how the
[Page-005+ 38]
<>secret name known only to the parents was given. Hardly any
<>secret name except that of Indra as Arjuna is known from the
<>Vedic literature.<sup>10</sup> It is to be noted that the rule as to giving the
<>designation of a Nakṣatra as the secret name or otherwise is
<>not illustrated by a single recorded name of a teacher in the
<>Brāhmaṇas.<sup>11</sup> The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa several times mentions
<>the adoption of a second name with a view to securing success,
<>and also refers to the adoption of another name for purposes
<>of distinction.<sup>12</sup>
<H>SŪTRA PERIOD
<P>The Gṛhya-sūtras provide us details about the name-giving
<>ceremony, the secret name, the common name, the {%abhivāda-%}
<>{%nīya%} name, the quality of the name as well as the formation of
<>the names of the boys and girls.
<H>{%Name-giving ceremony%}
<P>The Śāṅkhāyana<sup>13</sup> and the Pāraskara<sup>14</sup> Gṛhya-sūtras pres-
<>
<>cribe the name-giving ceremony to be performed on the tenth
<>day after the birth of the child but usually the Gṛhya-sūtras
<>recommend its performance after ten nights have elapsed.<sup>15</sup>
<>The Gṛhya-sūtras consider the first ten days after the birth of
<>the child as of impurity. Hence it is prescribed by the Hiraṇ-
<>yakeśin<sup>16</sup> that on the twelfth day the mother and son take a
<>bath, the house is made clean, the {%Sūtikāgni%} is taken away and
<>the {%Aupāsanāgni%} is established. Having put wood on that fire,
<>and having performed the rites down to the {%vyāhṛti%} oblations,
<>they sacrifice twelve oblations with the verses, “May Dhatri
<>give us wealth”; according to some (teachers they make)
<>thirteen (oblations). This, O Varuṇa ‘Hail, good luck?’ Then
<>let the father give the name to the child.
<P>The Gobhila Gṛhya-sūtra is very liberal with regard to the
<>performance of the name-giving ceremony as it says, “When
<>ten nights have elapsed after (the child's) birth, or a hundred
<>nights, or one year, the {%Nāmadheyakaraṇa%} (or giving a name
<>to the child) is performed”.<sup>17</sup> Gobhila<sup>18</sup> details the ceremony
<>as follows: He who is going to perform that ceremony, the
<>father or a representative of the father, sits down to the west
<>of the fire on northward-pointed {%Darbha%} grass, facing the east.
[Page-006+ 38]
<>Then the mother, having dressed the son in a clean garment,
<>hands him, from south to north, with his face turned to the
<>north, to the performer of the ceremony. She then passes
<>behind his back and sits down to the north of him, on north-
<>ward pointed {%Darbha%} grass. He then sacrifices to Prajāpati, to
<>the {%Tithi%} of the Child's birth, to the {%Nakṣatra%} of the child's
<>birth, and to the presiding deity of that Tithi and of that {%Nakṣatra.%}
<>He then murmurs the {%Mantra,%} “Who art thou? What art thou?,
<>touching the sense-organs at the boy's head. In the passage of
<>the {%Mantra:%} “Enter upon the month that belongs to Ahaspati
<>(i.e., the lord of the days), N.N.” After this the performer of
<>the rite should first announce the child's name to the mother.<sup>19</sup>
<>Further the sacrificial fee of a cow is recommended.<sup>20</sup>
<P>Pāraskara,<sup>21</sup> however, makes this ceremony very simple
<>when it states, “On the tenth day (after the birth of the child)
<>the father, having made (his wife) get up, and having fed the
<>brāhmaṇas, gives a name to the child”.
<H>{%The Secret Name%}
<P>The secret name is given to the child immediately after the
<>birth of the child or even before when the rite for quick
<>delivery is to be performed. As prescribed by the Gobhila
<>Gṛhya-sūtra, the father pronounces a name in the formula:
<>“A male will be born, such-and-such by name”; and the name
<>is kept secret.<sup>22</sup> Āpastamba<sup>23</sup> prescribes that the father gives
<>the name to the new-born child soon after his birth. This is a
<>{%Nakṣatra%} name and is secret. The Khādira Gṛhya-sūtra<sup>24</sup> also
<>prescribes that the secret name should be given immediately
<>after the birth of the child. Śaṅkhāyana<sup>25</sup> prescribes the giving
<>of the secret name by the father after feeding the new-born
<>child with a mixture of butter, honey, milk-curds and water,
<>or grind together rice and barley, from a golden vessel or with
<>a golden spoon. The Hiraṇyakeśin Gṛhya-sūtra,<sup>26</sup> however,
<>prescribes that on the twelfth day itself, the father should give
<>the child two names out of which the second name should be a
<>{%Nakṣatra%} name. The one name should be secret and by the
<>other they should call him.
<P>This means that according to Hiraṇyakeśin the secret name
<>may not essentially be a {%Nakṣatra%} name.
[Page-007+ 36]
<H>{%The Common Name%}
<P>A common name or a name for public use is given to the
<>child after the tenth day at the time of the performance of the
<>name-giving ceremony. Śaṅkhāyana<sup>27</sup> prescribes that the name
<>should be pleasing to the brāhmaṇas.
<H>{%The Abhivādanīya Name%}
<P>The Āśvalāyana Gṛhya-sūtra<sup>28</sup> prescribes that along with
<>the common name, the father may also find out for the child,
<>a name to be used at respectful salutations, such as that due
<>to the {%Ācārya%} at the ceremony of initiation; that name only
<>his mother and father should know till his initiation. While
<>the Gobhila Gṛhya-sūtra<sup>29</sup> prescribes that the {%abhivādanīya%}
<>name should be given by the teacher when the student comes
<>for study. The teacher chooses for him a name which he is to
<>use at respectful salutations — a name derived from the name of
<>a deity or a {%Nakṣatra.%} Or also of his Gotra, according to some
<>teachers.
<H>{%The Quality of the Name%}
<P>All the Gṛhya-sūtras unanimously agree that the name of
<>the son should begin with a sonant,<sup>30</sup> with a semi-vowel in it,
<>with a long vowel or the {%visarga%} at the end, and formed with a
<>{%kṛta%} suffix and it should not contain a {%taddhita%} suffix with an
<>even number<sup>31</sup> of syllables.<sup>32</sup> The Āśvalāyana Gṛhya-sūtra
<>says that the name should consist of two, or of four syllables.
<>Of two syllables, if he is desirous of firm position; of four
<>syllables, if he is desirous of holy lustre; but in every case
<>with an even number of syllables for men.<sup>33</sup>
<P>The Gṛhya-sūtras of Āpastamba<sup>34</sup> and Hiraṇyakeśin,<sup>35</sup> on
<>the authority of a Brāhmaṇa, prescribe the option of a name
<>containing the particle {%su,%} for such a name has a firm found-
<>ation. Pāraskara adds further that the name of a brāhmaṇa
<>should end in {%Śarman,%} that of a kṣatriya in {%Varman%} and that of
<>a vaiśya in {%Gupta.%}<sup>36</sup> Hiraṇyakeśin<sup>37</sup> prescribes two names for a
<>brāhmaṇa desirous of success. The second name should be a
<>{%Nakṣatra%} name. The one name should be secret and by the
<>other the parents should call the child. He further prescribes
[Page-008+ 37]
<>that the father should give him the name {%Somayājin%} i.e.,
<>performer of soma sacrifices, as his third name.<sup>38</sup>
<P>The name derived from the deity or {%Nakṣatra%} was permit-
<>ted using god's name but directly using god's name as the name
<>of an individual was forbidden.<sup>39</sup> The name of the father was
<>to be avoided but the child could be given the name of one of
<>his ancestors.<sup>40</sup>
<H>{%The Names of the Girls%}
<P>While some Gṛhya-sūtras<sup>41</sup> are silent about the names of
<>the girls, others<sup>42</sup> prescribe some rules for framing their names
<>as well:
<P>({%i%}) The name of a girl should have an odd number of
<>syllables.<sup>43</sup>
<P>({%ii%}) It should end in {%ā,%} with a {%taddhita%} suffix.<sup>44</sup>
<P>({%iii%}) It should end in {%dā.<sup>45</sup>%}
<P>({%iv%}) Āpastamba<sup>46</sup> says that girls who have the name of a
<>{%Nakṣatra,%} or of a river, or of a tree, are objectionable.
<P>This finds an echo later in the Manu-Smṛti where the girls
<>bearing such names are forbidden for marriage.<sup>47</sup>
<P>({%v%}) The Āpastamba Gṛhya-sūtra<sup>48</sup> also states that all girls
<>in whose names the last letter but one is {%r%} or {%l,%} one
<>should avoid in wooing.
<P>({%vi%}) The name of a girl should not end in {%dattā%} or {%rakṣitā%}
<>preceded by the name of a deity; etc.<sup>49</sup>
<P>We find some distinguishing characteristics between the
<>names of the boys and the girls. The names of the boys are
<>prescribed to end in {%visarga%} while of the girls with {%ā%} or {%dā.%}
<>The names of the boys are ordained to end with a {%kṛta%} suffix
<>while of the girls with a {%taddhita%} suffix. But the rules prohibi-
<>ting certain kinds of names for girls were frequently violated
<>or continued to be violated as is evident from numerous such
<>examples in literature.
<H>SMṚTI PERIOD
<P>Manu simplifies the system and lays down the following
<>four simple rules:
<P>({%i%}) A name should be given to a child on the 10th or 12th
<>day on a pious date, {%Muhūrta%} or {%Nakṣatra.%}<sup>50</sup>
[Page-009+ 38]
<P>({%ii%}) The name of a brāhmaṇa should be indicative of

<H>NIBANDHA PERIOD
<P>The Mitākṣarā, a commentary on the Yājñavalkya Smṛti,
<>quotes Śaṅkha, who says that a father should give to his son a
<>name connected with a family deity.<sup>54</sup>
<P>There is another way of deriving names from {%Nakṣatras.%}
<>In some of the medieval Jyotiṣa works, each of the 27
<>{%Nakṣatras%} is divided into four {%pādas,%} and to each {%pāda%} of a
<>{%Nakṣatra%} a specific letter is assigned (e.g. {%cu, ce, co,%} and {%la%} for
<>the four {%pādas%} of Aśvinī) from which a person born in a
<>particular {%pāda%} of Aśvinī was called Cūḍāmaṇi, Cedīśa, Coleśa,
<>or Lakṣmaṇa.<sup>55</sup> These names are called {%Nakṣatra-nāma;%} they
<>are secret and muttered into the ear of the brahmacārin at his
<>{%upanayana%} even now. Even so late a work as the Dharma-
<>sindhu (A.D. 1790) disapproves of names, not warranted by the
<>Smṛtis.
<P>Now we consider the views of grammarians on naming a
<>person.
<P>Pāṇini divides the names into four principal classes.<sup>56</sup>
<P>(1) Gotra names mentioned in Chapter 4, {%pāda%} 1 of the
<>Aṣṭādhyāyī, e.g. Gārgya.
<P>(2) Patronymics, e.g. Upagu's son called Aupagava
<>({%Tasyāpatyam,%} IV. 1. 92).
<P>(3) Names derived from localities, where a person or his
<>ancestors lived.
[Page-010+ 38]
<P>(4) Personal names proper (V. 3. 78, 84; V. 3. 65; VI. 2. 106;
<>VI. 2. 159; VI. 2. 165).
<P>Patañjali in his Mahābhāṣya mentions Pāṇini by matro-
<>nymic.<sup>57</sup>
<P>He says that parents name their child some days after his
<>birth just as Devadatta and Yajñadatta and as a result other
<>people also know him by the same name.<sup>58</sup>
<P>The Aṅgavijjā,<sup>59</sup> a work generally placed in the third
<>century, has much useful material about names. The 26th
<>chapter of this work is devoted to proper names. The general
<>rules prescribed for naming the persons are as follows:
<P>The names of men were formed from {%gottanāma, ayanāma%}
<>(constellations), {%kamma%} (profession), {%sarīra%} (body) {%karaṇa%}
<>(office)<sup>60</sup> Under {%aya%} are quoted the examples {%kinnaka, kata-%}
<>{%raka, chadditaka. Sarīra%} names are qualitative. They are {%saṇḍa%}
<>(bull), {%vikaḍa%} (terrible), {%kharaḍa%} (lowest), {%khallaḍa%} (bald), {%vipiṇa%}
<>(forest).<sup>61</sup>
<P>The friendly names ended with the suffixes {%ṇandi, nanda,%}
<>{%diṇṇa, ṇandaka%} and {%nandika.%}<sup>62</sup>
<P>The names indicating defects of the body are {%khaṇḍasīsa%}
<>(broken head), {%kāṇa%} (blind of one eye), {%pillaka%} (discarded),
<>{%kujja%} (hunchback), {%vāmaṇaka%} (dwarf), {%kuvi(ṇi)ka%} (lame),
<>{%sabala%} (spotted), {%khañja%} (lame), and {%vaḍabha%} (distorted).<sup>63</sup>
<P>Proper names were also formed on the basis of complexion,
<>fair complexion being designated as {%avadātaka, seḍa%} and {%seḍila;%}
<>light black as {%sāma, sāmali%} and {%sāmaka-sāmalā,%} and black as
<>{%kālaka%} and {%kālikā.%}
<P>Names based on beauty of the human body are: {%sumuha%}
<>(handsome), {%sudaṃsaṇa%} (pleasing personality), {%surūva%} (beauti-
<>ful), {%jāta%} (well-born), and {%sugata%} (pleasing gait).
<P>The names based on age are: {%bālaka%} (child), {%ḍaharaka%}
<>(boy), {%majjhima%} (middle-aged), {%thavira-thera%} (old).<sup>64</sup>
<P>The following endings of proper names are mentioned:
<>{%tata, dātta, diṇṇa, mitta, gutta, bhūta pāla, pāli, samma, yāsa,%}
<>{%rāta, ghosa, bhāṇu, viddhi, nandi, nanda, māna, uttarā, pālita,%}
<>{%rakhi, nandana, ṇandaka, and sahitamahaka.<sup>65</sup>%}

<H>Names of the Gupta Kings
<>and Queens
<>NAMES OF THE GUPTA KINGS
<P>All Gupta kings excepting Ghaṭotkaca have the surname
<>‘gupta’ at the end. Before taking up the names of individual
<>Gupta kings we may discuss the significance of the term
<>‘gupta’. Does it signify the family (a vaiśya family) or the
<>predecessor of the family?
<P>In the inscriptions, Śrī Gupta appears as the founder of the
<>dynasty. His name is always given first in the dynastic table.<sup>1</sup>
<>Moreover, we find in the Udayagiri Cave inscription, of the
<>year 106<sup>2</sup> the wording {%“Guptānvyācām nṛpasattamānāṃ rājye”%}
<>(in the reign of the family of the best of kings, belonging to
<>the Gupta lineage) which shows that all these kings belonged
<>to a family which was founded by the above Gupta; hence
<>they were called Guptas.<sup>3</sup>
<P>In Śrī Gupta {%‘Śrī’%} is an honorific term as in the case of other
<>Gupta emperors mentioned in the inscriptions.<sup>4</sup> Had the name
<>of the first king been ‘Śrī Gupta’, it would have been mention-
<>ed as Śrī Śrī Gupta<sup>5</sup> as we find in the case of the name of
<>Śrīmatī in the Deo-Barnark Inscription of Jīvitagupta II.<sup>6</sup> If
<>we accept that Gupta was the name of the first king of the
<>family we may dismiss the possibility of the Gupta ending
<>signifying a surname.
<P>Now the question arises why the family was named after
<>this Gupta? In many cases families are named after some
<>important person born therein, and when once a family is so
<>named, the tradition is maintained even though the successors
<>may reach much higher positions. Prior to this the family
<>might not have attained any significant status. For the first
<>time this Gupta got the status of a Mahārāja as is mentioned
[Page-015+ 39]
<>in the Gupta inscriptions,<sup>7</sup> the status remained unchanged in
<>the second generation, and from the third generation the Gupta
<>kings became Mahārājādhirājas. Literally, Mahārāja means a
<>great king. But the apparent and deliberate differentiation in
<>the status of the earlier and later kings suggests that the poli-
<>tical status of this Gupta was not much high in his own times.<sup>8</sup>
<>Probably he was only a feudal chief and not an independent
<>king.
<P>The name Gupta is so short that it looks suspiciously queer.
<>But we must point out that the first part has not been lost or
<>damaged in the inscription. Palaeographically it is quite
<>categorical that the name is Gupta, there is no loss or damage
<>of syllables.
<P>In ordinary life in all societies we find the convenient
<>tendency to drop one part of the name. We address a person
<>by the {%pūrvapada%} or the {%uttarapada%} whichever is convenient to
<>us. By the passage of time that name becomes his popular
<>name. In some cases even his original name may be forgotten.
<>In our own case {%Gupta%} may have been the {%uttarapada%} of the
<>name of the first king by which he may have been generally
<>known. The name Gupta was probably very popular, so much
<>so that the dynasty itself was named after it.
<P>The practice of shortening the names is not known in the
<>Vedic times; it is noticed by Pāṇini and seems to have been
<>fashionable in the times of Katyāyana and Patañjali.<sup>9</sup> Several
<>examples of it are also met with in the Buddhist literature.
<P>In modern historical usage Śrī has become so much asso-
<>ciated with the name of the first king of the Gupta dynasty
<>that it has become a real part of his name generally written as
<>‘Śrī Gupta’.
<P>The psychology behind it may be that the use of the
<>smaller names sounds queer and it is brought at par with
<>other names in the dynasty, e.g. Candragupta, Samudragupta,
<>Kumāragupta, etc.
<P>V.A. Smith<sup>10</sup> suggests that this name was not simply Gupta,
<>but Śrīgupta, implying thereby that Śrī is an integral part of
<>his name, not the honorific prefix. Fleet<sup>11</sup> has thoroughly
<>refuted all his arguments and we may not discuss them here.
<P>Some corroborative evidence for the historicity of Śrī
[Page-016+ 39]
<>Gupta is afforded by two seals of which one is in Prakrit and
<>gives the legend {%‘Gautasya’%} while the other is in Sanskrit and
<>has the reading {%‘Śrī Guptasya’.%} It is most probable that these
<>seals belong to the founder of the Gupta dynasty, especially
<>the Sanskrit Seal.<sup>12</sup>
<P>The dynastic name is derived from the termination Gupta
<>of each king's personal name, showing that the line had no
<>respectable origin as clan, tribe, or caste.<sup>13</sup>
<P>The word ‘Gupta’ is derived from § gup to protect.<sup>14</sup> The
<>Viṣṇu Purāṇa<sup>15</sup> says — “(The termination) {%śarman%} is prescribed
<>for a brāhmaṇa; {%varman%} belongs to a kṣatriya; (and) a name
<>characterised by {%gupta%} and {%dāsa%} is approved of in the case of
<>(respectively) a vaiśya and a sūdra”. The commentary in the
<>Bombay edition gives as examples, Somaśarman, Indravarman,
<>Candragupta, and Sivadāsa.<sup>16</sup> The Mānavadharmaśāstra<sup>17</sup>
<>also lays down a similar rule without specifying the termina-
<>tions. On the basis of these authorities, it has been suggested
<>that the Early Guptas were not of a high caste, being at best
<>vaiśyas, and hence felt pride in their matrimonial alliance with
<>the Licchavis.<sup>18</sup>
<P>But we find that the rules regarding the naming of persons
<>prescribed in the Dharmaśāstras were not always strictly
<>followed. To give only a few examples the name of the well
<>known astronomer, Brahmagupta, a brāhmaṇa, ended in
<>‘Gupta’<sup>19</sup> and likewise Dāsavarman is the name of a brāhmaṇa,
<>in line 36 of the Nerur grant of Vijayāditya (dated Śaka-saṃvat
<>627).<sup>20</sup>
<P>We know of the names of the kings ending in Gupta as
<>early as second century B.C. from the records of the excava-
<>tions and explorations conducted in Central India.<sup>21</sup> It may
<>be noted from Tālagund stone pillar inscription of the time of
<>Śāntivarman (A.D. 455-70)<sup>22</sup> that the grandson of a brāh-
<>maṇa king Mayūraśarman was named as Kāku(ut)sthavarman.
<>Thus on consideration no weightage can be given to the word
<>{%‘gupta’%} denoting a Vaiśya class.
<P>In this context we must note that Prabhāvatīguptā, the
<>daughter of Candragupta II and chief queen of the Vākāṭaka
<>king Rudrasena II describes herself as belonging to the
<>Dhāraṇa {%gotra%} in her Poona and Rithpur copper plate inscrip-
[Page-017+ 39]
<>tions.<sup>23</sup> Dhāraṇa is clearly the {%gotra%} of her father, as the {%gotra%}
<>of her husband is specifically mentioned as ‘Viṣṇuvṛddha’ in
<>the Chammak copper plate inscription of Pravarasena II.<sup>24</sup>
<P>This Dhāraṇa {%gotra%} has been variously interpreted by
<>scholars.
<P>Jayaswal takes it to stand for {%Dhanri,%} a Jāṭ clan found in
<>Amritsar, and on the basis of the Kaumudīmahotsava he
<>concludes that Candragupta I was a {%Kāraskara%} or {%Kakkar jāṭ.%}<sup>25</sup>
<>This view has been supported by Gokhale.<sup>26</sup>
<P>Jayaswal emphasizes the similarity between the name of the
<>{%Dhāraṇīya jāṭs%} in Gaṅgānagar district of Rajasthan and the
<>Dhāraṇa {%gotra%} of the Guptas.<sup>27</sup> Candragomin's grammatical
<>illustration {%“ajayat jarto Hūṇān”%} (The {%jarta%} or Jāṭ king defeated
<>the Hūṇas) has also been interpreted by Jayaswal to refer to
<>the Gupta ruler Skandagupta's victory over the Hūṇas.<sup>28</sup> Thus
<>the jāṭ origin of the Guptas has been a favourite thesis of
<>Jayaswal.
<P>According to Raychaudhuri the Dhāraṇa {%gotra%} of the
<>Guptas suggests that they were related to Dhāriṇī, the chief
<>queen of Agnimitra Śuṅga.<sup>29</sup> This view is untenable. The
<>similarity in the two names is not sufficient to establish the
<>origin of the Dhārṇa {%gotra.%}
<P>On the basis of the evidence of the Skandapurāṇa Dashrath
<>Sharma<sup>30</sup> says that Dhāraṇa was a {%gotra%} of the brāhmaṇas of
<>Dharmāraṇya, a tract in the present Mirzapur district of
<>Eastern Uttar Pradesh. But Sharma is not ready to accept
<>that the Guptas were brāhmaṇas, he considers them to be
<>either kṣatriyas or vaiśyas who adopted the {%gotra%} of their
<>{%gurus,%} as sanctioned by the laws of the Smṛtis and the
<>Dharmasūtras.<sup>31</sup>
<P>But Goyal<sup>32</sup> considers the Guptas to be brāhmaṇas. He
<>relies on the evidence of their matrimonial alliances:
<P>We find that Prabhāvatīguptā, the daughter of Candragupta
<>II was married to the brāhmaṇa king Rudrasena II.<sup>33</sup> Kadamba
<>king Kāku(ut)sthavarman who was a brāhmaṇa says that he
<>married one of his daughters to a Gupta king.<sup>34</sup> Buddhist
<>scholar Paramārtha (A.D. 600) says that Bālāditya, the Gupta
<>king, married his sister to Vasurāta, a brāhmaṇa by caste.<sup>35</sup>
<>According to the Mandasor inscription of Yaśodharman
[Page-018+ 39]
<>Bhānuguptā (most probably a daughter of the Gupta king
<>Bhānugupta) was the 'wife of a certain Ravikīrtti, evidently a
<>brāhmaṇa, who was the grandfather of Dharmadosha, the
<>minister of Yaśodharman.<sup>36</sup>
<P>Thus, we see that three of the Gupta princesses were married
<>to brāhmaṇas.<sup>37</sup> There is only one instance of the Guptas
<>marrying a daughter of a Kadamba king, who was a
<>brāhmaṇa.<sup>38</sup>
<P>It is to be noted that matrimonial alliances played a signifi-
<>cant part in the foreign policy of the Guptas. Candragupta I
<>rose to power by marrying the Licchavi princess Kumāradevī
<>and Samudragupta accepted the offers of daughters from his
<>feudatories. Thus, marriages with the most powerful and dis-
<>tinguished royal families in different parts of India continued
<>to be an important policy of the Guptas.<sup>39</sup>
<P>Hence, the matrimonial alliances of the Guptas seem to
<>have sprung from political considerations.<sup>40</sup> Politically the
<>Kadambas were no match for the Guptas. It may be inferred
<>that it was on account of political pressures or as a matter of
<>pride for the Kadambas that they had married their daughter
<>to the Gupta king. We can explain all the matrimonial allian-
<>ces of the Guptas even without bringing political reasons in the
<>picture. As we know, intercaste marriages, especially of the
<>{%anuloma%} type, have been permitted by the Smṛtis. In three out
<>of the four cases Gupta princesses were married to brāhmaṇa
<>bridegrooms. If these are taken to have been {%anuloma%}
<>marriages Guptas could have belonged to any of the remaining
<>three {%varṇas.%} It is only the marriage of a Kadamba princess
<>with a Gupta king which requires the Guptas to have been
<>brāhmaṇas, otherwise it will be a case of a {%pratiloma%} marriage.
<P>The Guptas do not mention their caste in any of their
<>records. Had they been brāhmaṇas they must have been proud to
<>refer to it, especially because they were staunch supporters of
<>Hinduism. We find a parallel in the case of Pāla kings of
<>Bengal who are silent about their caste since they were
<>Buddhists.
<P>Finally Candragupta I agreed to have a joint coinage with
<>the Licchavis after his marriage with the Licchavi princess
<>Kumāradevī. Had the Gupta kings been brāhmaṇas, they
[Page-019+ 38]
<>would not have agreed to have a joint coinage (bearing the
<>legend {%‘Licchavayaḥ’,%} the Licchavis) with the Licchavis who
<>were {%Vrātya%} kṣatriyas.<sup>41</sup> Even if the Guptas had agreed for a
<>joint coinage as a political matter, they might have objected
<>the word {%‘Licchavayaḥ’%} on the coins. More astonishing is the
<>fact that even the name of the Guptas is not linked with the

<div n="P"/>Ghaṭotkaca was the name of a son of Bhīma-sena by the

<div n="lb"/>tively it means a person having a hairless head.<sup>49</sup> In Prācīna
<div n="lb"/>Caritrakośa it has been suggested that Ghaṭotkaca was so
<div n="lb"/>called as his head was like a {%ghaṭa%} (pitcher) and was hairless.<sup>50</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Tripathi suggests on the basis of the Skanda Purāṇa that

<div n="lb"/>from the Purāṇas defining the extent of the Gupta territory
<div n="lb"/>with the period before Samudragupta, i.e., under Candragupta
<div n="lb"/>I.<sup>53</sup> It has been suggested that Caṇḍasena of the play ‘Kaumudī-
<div n="lb"/>Mahotsava’ is to be identified with Candragupta I. The
<div n="lb"/>Licchavi alliance is the common point in the account given by
<div n="lb"/>the drama and the inscriptions.<sup>54</sup> Other details of the drama,
<div n="lb"/>however, do not support this identification. The drama
<div n="lb"/>condemns Caṇḍasena as an usurper and belonging to low caste
<div n="lb"/>whom the citizens of Magadha could not tolerate and drove out
<div n="lb"/>to die in exile. Linguistically also Caṇḍasena and Candragupta
<div n="lb"/>are different names. Candra can become Caṇḍa in Prakrit but
<div n="lb"/>Gupta cannot be transformed into Sena. Moreover, in the fifth
<div n="lb"/>act of the play we are informed through a character Lokākṣī
<div n="lb"/>that the cursed Caṇḍasena has been killed and his royal family
<div n="lb"/>uprooted.<sup>55</sup> Thus we know about the total annihilation of the

<div n="lb"/>He has been mentioned as a {%‘Paramabhāgavata’%} (a devout
<div n="lb"/>devotee of Lord Viṣṇu).<sup>59</sup> No. 2, L. 10 gives the justification
<div n="lb"/>of his name Samudragupta.<sup>60</sup> Mookerji says that the name
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta was probably a title assumed after his conquests.
<div n="lb"/>It means ‘protected by the sea’ and may refer to his dominion
<div n="lb"/>which extended upto the sea. The Mathurā Inscription of
<div n="lb"/>Candragupta II actually describes the fame of his conquests as
<div n="lb"/>extending up to the four oceans ({%caturudadhisalilāsvāditaya-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%śasaḥ%}). The name Samudragupta may be split up into two parts,
<div n="lb"/>Samudra being his personal name, and Gupta being his
<div n="lb"/>surname. This is supported by the fact that the obverse of his
<div n="lb"/>coins of standard type sometimes bears the legend ‘Samudra’
<div n="lb"/>while the reverse has {%‘Parākramaḥ’%} as his title. The name
<div n="lb"/>‘Samudra’ also appears on some other types of his coins, such
<div n="lb"/>as the Archer type and Battle-Axe type.<sup>61</sup> Mookerji<sup>62</sup> holds that
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta's personal name was Kāca and that Samudra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta was his title. But the identification of Kāca with
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta has been rightly opposed by scholars.<sup>63</sup> Vāmana
<div n="lb"/>in his Kāvyalaṃkāra<sup>64</sup> refers to Candraprakāśa as the son of
<div n="lb"/>Candragupta which Goyal takes to be another name of
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta.<sup>65</sup> But it seems to be the name of a local king of
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā rather than that of a member of the Imperial Gupta
<div n="lb"/>dynasty.<sup>66</sup> Another probable and most suitable explanation
<div n="lb"/>of the name ‘Samudragupta’ may be ‘protected by Lord Śiva’,
<div n="lb"/>Samudra being an epithet of Śiva.<sup>67</sup>
<div n="P"/>Samudragupta is given many epithets in No. 1. Some of

6. {%Govindagupta:%}¦ (No. 42, L. 2; No. 32, L. 3):
<div n="lb"/>In No. 42, he is mentioned as the son of Candragupta II. His
<div n="lb"/>mother's name was Dhruvasvāminī. No. 32 explains the basis
<div n="lb"/>of his name: “The lord of the earth, i.e. king Candragupta,
<div n="lb"/>produced a son whose exalted name was Govindagupta, who
<div n="lb"/>was as famous as Govinda (Viṣṇu) for the glory of his virtues,
<div n="lb"/>and who resembled the sons of Diti and Aditi, i.e. the demons
<div n="lb"/>and gods.”<sup>77</sup> The poet means that Govindagupta resembled
<div n="lb"/>demons in physical strength and valour, and gods in spiritual
<div n="lb"/>virtues.
<div n="P"/>Govindagupta probably ruled as emperor between (his
<div n="lb"/>father) Candragupta II and (his younger brother) Kumāra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta 1. His reign could not have been more than three years,
<div n="lb"/>the interval between the last known date of Candragupta II
<div n="lb"/>(G. E. 93) and the earliest known date of Kumāragupta I (G.E.
<div n="lb"/>96).<sup>78</sup> P. L. Gupta assigns his short regnal period between
<div n="lb"/>A.D. 412 and 415.<sup>79</sup> That Govindagupta could have ruled as
<div n="lb"/>emperor only for a very short period is also evident from the
<div n="lb"/>fact that he has left no coins. Being a collateral, Govindagupta
<div n="lb"/>does not appear in the genealogical table in the inscriptions of
<div n="lb"/>Kumāragupta and his successors.<sup>80</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is also likely that Kumāragupta defeated or ousted

[Page-028+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Vainya is the synonym for the first king ‘Pṛthu’.<sup>109</sup> Hiranand
<div n="lb"/>Shastri mentions Vainya as a synonym of Kubera, the god of
<div n="lb"/>wealth. According to Sir Richard Burn {%Vainya%} was another
<div n="lb"/>name of {%Vajra%} whom Hiuen Tsang mentions as the son of
<div n="lb"/>Bālāditya. He chiefly relies on the St. Petersburg dictionary
<div n="lb"/>where Vainya is derived from Vena and is connected with
<div n="lb"/>Indra; {%Vajra%} is the thunderbolt and {%Vainya%} is a patronymic
<div n="lb"/>from Vena who is Indra.<sup>110</sup> But the suggested identification is
<div n="lb"/>extremely far-fetched. {%Vajra%} cannot by any stretch of imagina-
<div n="lb"/>tion be described as a synonym of {%Vainya.%} Moreover, it is diffi-
<div n="lb"/>cult to believe that Hiuen Tsang would have referred to the
<div n="lb"/>king by such a name in preference of the real name.
<div n="P"/>In No. 51 Vainyagupta is mentioned as a {%paramabhāgavata%}
<div n="lb"/>and {%mahārājādhirāja,%} but in No. 53 he is described as a devotee
<div n="lb"/>of Lord Śiva ({%bhagavān mahādevapādānudhyāta%}) and a {%mahārāja%}
<div n="lb"/>only. Some scholars hold the opinion that it shall be wrong to
<div n="lb"/>disconnect Vainyagupta from the Gupta family on the basis of
<div n="lb"/>the argument that the Guptas were Vaiṣṇavas while Vainya-
<div n="lb"/>gupta professed to be a Śaiva.<sup>111</sup> We find both the epithets
<div n="lb"/>{%‘paramabhāgavata’%} and {%‘mahādevapādānudhyāta’%} for him in our
<div n="lb"/>records.
<div n="P"/>It is interesting that even his Pādadāsa and Uparika are
<div n="lb"/>styled as mahārājas (LL. 3 and 16). His title Mahārāja, there-
<div n="lb"/>fore, cannot prove that Vainyagupta was an insignificant
<div n="lb"/>prince.<sup>112</sup>
<div n="P"/>The legend on No. 51, though partially preserved, resembles
<div n="lb"/>in point of style the legend on the other seals of the Imperial
<div n="lb"/>Guptas. Here Vainyagupta is specifically called {%paramabhāgavata.%}
<div n="lb"/>Moreover, his name, like those of other kings in the Gupta
<div n="lb"/>dynasty ends in the word Gupta. It is thus clear that Vainya-
<div n="lb"/>gupta belonged to the line of the Imperial Guptas. He seems
<div n="lb"/>to have ruled in any case over considerable parts of Bengal and
<div n="lb"/>Bihar<sup>113</sup> almost immediately after Budhagupta. We do not
<div n="lb"/>know anything about the relationship of Vainyagupta with
<div n="lb"/>Budhagupta and Bhānugupta of the Eraṇ Inscription of A.D.
<div n="lb"/>510.<sup>114</sup> Some scholars assign him a reign of four years before
<div n="lb"/>Bhānugupta (A.D. 510).<sup>115</sup>
<div n="P"/>The regnal period of Vainyagupta witnessed a considerable
<div n="lb"/>decline in the power and prestige of the Imperial Guptas. The
[Page-029+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>rise of the ruling dynasty consisting of Dharmāditya, Gopa-
<div n="lb"/>candra and Samācāradeva in Central and South-West Bengal
<div n="lb"/>in the first half of the sixth Century A.D., possibly points to
<div n="lb"/>the extirpation of Gupta rule from Bengal excepting the
<div n="lb"/>bhukti (province) of Puṇḍravardhana (North Bengal).<sup>116</sup>

3. {%Bhānugupta%}¦ (No. 19, L. 5):
<div n="lb"/>He is known only from No. 19. His no other coin or seal has
<div n="lb"/>yet come to light. As regards the position of Bhānugupta, seve-
<div n="lb"/>ral alternatives are possible. First, he may have been a succes-
<div n="lb"/>sor of Vainyagupta and the dominions of both may have
<div n="lb"/>included parts of Eastern Malwa. Second, Vainyagupta may have
<div n="lb"/>been the lord of the eastern part of the Gupta Empire when its
<div n="lb"/>western part was being ruled by Bhānugupta. Third, Bhānu-
<div n="lb"/>gupta may have been a viceroy in the Malwa region like
<div n="lb"/>Govindagupta and Ghaṭotkacagupta. It is possible that he be-
<div n="lb"/>longed to the Imperial Gupta line but whether he succeeded
<div n="lb"/>Vainygupta, or the two ruled at the same time respectively
<div n="lb"/>over the western and eastern parts of the empire, is difficult to
<div n="lb"/>determine. The latter view seems more probable and this in-
<div n="lb"/>ternal dissension perhaps paved the way for the downfall of the
<div n="lb"/>empire.<sup>117</sup> Bhānugupta, in spite of the high encomiums paid to
<div n="lb"/>his bravery in Eraṇ Inscription, remains a shadowy figure, and
<div n="lb"/>we do not know what was his position in the Gupta Imperial
<div n="lb"/>family, or what part he played in the dark days of the Gupta
<div n="lb"/>empire.<sup>118</sup>
<div n="P"/>His name is based on the god Sun ‘Bhānu’.

<div n="P"/>3 (b). {%Dhruvasvāminī%} (No. 42, LL. 3-4):

<div n="lb"/>mention her as the wife of Candragupta II and the mother of
<div n="lb"/>Govindagupta. As we have noticed Dhruvadevī elsewhere
<div n="lb"/>appears as the wife of Candragupta II and mother of Kumāra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta I. It is not much likely that Candragupta II had two
<div n="lb"/>queens with almost identical names. As the real name of the
<div n="lb"/>two is the same (Dhruva) it would be better to hold that
<div n="lb"/>Dhruvasvāminī was another name of Dhruvadevī and Kumāra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta I and Govindagupta were real brothers.

<H>Names of Feudatory Kings and
<>High Officers
<>{%NAMES OF FEUDATORY KINGS%}
<P>First, we analyse the names of subordinate rulers or feuda-
<>tory kings dividing them into the following categories:
<H>{%Names based on Gaṇapati%}

;
; ENTRIES (2)
;
<L>24<pc>038<k1>gaRapati<k2>gaRapati
1. {%Gaṇapati%}¦ (No. 1, L. 13):
<div n="lb"/>One of the kings said to have been uprooted by Samudragupta
<div n="lb"/>in northern India. The name violates the laws laid down by
<div n="lb"/>the Gṛhya-sūtras which prohibit the giving of the names of
<div n="lb"/>deities to human-beings directly.<sup>1</sup>
<LEND>

<L>25<pc>038<k1>gaRapatinAga<k2>gaRapatinAga
2. {%Gaṇapatināga%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
<div n="lb"/>Another king of Āryyāvartta defeated by Samudragupta. The
<div n="lb"/>first part is Gaṇapati and the second is ‘nāga’, which signifies
<div n="lb"/>that the king belonged to the Nāga dynasty. He probably
<div n="lb"/>ruled at Mathurā.<sup>2</sup>
<LEND>
<H>{%Names based on Moon%}

<L>26<pc>038<k1>candravarmman<k2>candravarmman
1. {%Candravarmman:%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
<div n="lb"/>One of the kings of Āryyāvartta defeated by Samudragupta.
<div n="lb"/>The first part is Candra and second is ‘Varmma’ which is a
<div n="lb"/>form for the original term ‘varman’, a surname generally used
<div n="lb"/>for kṣatriyas. He may be identified with the king of that name
<div n="lb"/>whose record has been found at Susunia in Bankura district,
<div n="lb"/>Bengal.<sup>3</sup>
<LEND>

<L>27<pc>038<k1>suraSmicandra<k2>suraSmicandra
2. {%Suraśmicandra%}¦ (No. 18, L. 4):
<div n="lb"/>He is described as the ruler of the country that lies between the
<div n="lb"/>rivers Kālindī and Narmadā, and governing with the qualities
<div n="lb"/>of a regent lording, one of the quarters of the world, and en-
<div n="lb"/>joying the title of a mahārāja during the reign of Budhagupta.
[Page-039+ 37]
<div n="P"/>Literally it means ‘a moon possessed of good rays’.
<LEND>
<H>{%Names based on Nāga%}

<L>28<pc>039<k1>nAgadatta<k2>nAgadatta
1. {%Nāgadatta%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
<div n="lb"/>One of the kings of Āryyāvartta defeated by Samudragupta.
<div n="lb"/>The first part is Nāga which refers most likely to ‘a holy ser-
<div n="lb"/>pent’ and the second is ‘datta’ meaning given. Thus the full
<div n="lb"/>name may mean ‘born by the grace of a Nāga’. D.C. Sircar
<div n="lb"/>takes the compound as a Caturthī Tatpuruṣa instance mean-
<div n="lb"/>ing ‘dedicated to a Nāga’. However, the compounds are usually
<div n="lb"/>taken as Tṛtīyā Tatpuruṣa instances. The names do not indi-
<div n="lb"/>cate towards bali but such names as Gurudatta, Śivadatta and
<div n="lb"/>Nāgadatta may exhibit reverence to Guru, Śiva or Nāga by
<div n="lb"/>whose worship or blessings the son was born which is attested
<div n="lb"/>to by tradition of such names.
<LEND>

<L>29<pc>039<k1>nAgasena<k2>nAgasena
2. {%Nāgasena%}¦ (No. 1, L. 13, 21):
<div n="lb"/>The first part of the name is Nāga and the second is sena.
<div n="lb"/>Nāgasena of the L. 13 and L. 21 looks to be the same.<sup>4</sup> Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to L. 21 he was one of the kings of Āryyāvartta uprooted
<div n="lb"/>by Samudragupta. In L. 13 he is mentioned as having been
<div n="lb"/>defeated by Samudragupta by the valour of his arms. He
<div n="lb"/>seems to have been an important king.<sup>5</sup>
<LEND>
<H>{%Names based on Śiva%}

<L>30<pc>039<k1>rudradatta<k2>rudradatta
1. {%Rudradatta%}¦ (No. 52, L. 3):
<div n="lb"/>He is given the designation of a {%mahārāja%} and is mentioned as
<div n="lb"/>a {%pādadāsa%} (slave of the feet) of Vainyagupta. The first part
<div n="lb"/>literally meaning roaring, dreadful or terrible<sup>6</sup> denotes Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>the second ‘given’; the full name meaning ‘given by Lord Śiva’.
<LEND>

<L>31<pc>039<k1>rudradeva<k2>rudradeva
2. {%Rudradeva%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
<div n="lb"/>He is described as one of the kings of Āryyāvartta defeated by
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta. The first part of the name is Rudra which
<div n="lb"/>denotes Lord Śiva and the second is ‘deva’ which means ‘god’.
<div n="lb"/>It is another name based on Lord Śiva. Rudradeva has been
<div n="lb"/>differently identified by various scholars. Dr. D.C. Sircar has
<div n="lb"/>identified him with the Western Satrap Rudrasena II or his
<div n="lb"/>son Rudrasena III, while K.P. Jayaswal, K.N. Dikshit and
<div n="lb"/>R.N. Dandekar identify him with Vākāṭaka Rudrasena I.
<div n="lb"/>U.N. Roy<sup>7</sup> differing with the above scholars proposes his
[Page-040+ 37]
<div n="lb"/>identification with Vākāṭaka Mahārāja Rudrasena II, the son
<div n="lb"/>of Pṛthviṣeṇa I.
<LEND>

<L>32<pc>040<k1>ugrasena<k2>ugrasena
3. {%Ugrasena%}¦ (No. 1, L. 20):
<div n="lb"/>He is mentioned as a ruler of Pālakka during the reign of
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta. Ugra meaning ‘powerful mighty or terrible’, is
<div n="lb"/>another name of Rudra or Śiva.<sup>8</sup> Sena is merely a surname.
<div n="lb"/>Or we can give another explanation of the whole as {%Ugrā senā%}
<div n="lb"/>{%asya,%} i.e. ‘having mighty army’.
<LEND>
<div n="H"/>{%Names based on Sun%}
<div n="P"/>We find only one such name which is as given below: —

<L>33<pc>040<k1>praBAkara<k2>praBAkara
1. {%Prabhākara%}¦ (No. 32, L. 8):
<div n="lb"/>He is described as a king (bhūmipati) and a destroyer of the
<div n="lb"/>enemies of the Gupta dynasty. He was the overlord of Datta-
<div n="lb"/>bhaṭa. He is not known from any other source. The name of his
<div n="lb"/>capital or territory is not mentioned. Probably he was the con-
<div n="lb"/>temporary local chief of Daśapura and a feudatory ally of the
<div n="lb"/>Guptas in their struggle against the Hūṇas.<sup>9</sup> Dattabhaṭa does
<div n="lb"/>not include in the inscription the genealogy of his master. It is
<div n="lb"/>possible that Prabhākara was a self-made man who did not
<div n="lb"/>have a distinguished ancestor worthy of record. He may have
<div n="lb"/>been appointed as a ruler of Daśapura by the paramount
<div n="lb"/>power, after the extinction of the Varman dynasty.<sup>10</sup> That
<div n="lb"/>Prabhākara was not a scion of the Varman dynasty would also
<div n="lb"/>appear from his name which, unlike the names of the known
<div n="lb"/>members of that dynasty, does not end in Varman.<sup>11</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>name violates the laws of Gṛhyasūtras which forbid the direct
<div n="lb"/>imposition of the names of deities upon human-beings.
<LEND>
<H>{%Names based on Viṣṇu%}

<L>34<pc>040<k1>acyutanandin<k2>acyutanandin
1. {%Acyutanandin%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
<div n="lb"/>He is included in the list of kings of Āryyāvartta forcefully
<div n="lb"/>uprooted by Samudragupta. Acyuta is the name of Viṣṇu or
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa,<sup>12</sup> and Nandin is the name of an attendant of Śiva and
<div n="lb"/>also the name of Śiva's bull.<sup>13</sup> So literally the expression would
<div n="lb"/>mean ‘one who is a servant of god Visṇu’. Nandin also means
<div n="lb"/>gladdening or rejoicing.<sup>14</sup> So it may also mean ‘one who
<div n="lb"/>pleases or wins over god Viṣṇu’.
<div n="P"/>Acyutanandin seems to have been a ruler of Ahicchatra
[Page-041+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>(near Bareilly district).<sup>15</sup> The Purāṇas give names ending in
<div n="lb"/>‘Nandin’ in the list of Nāga kings and coins bearing ‘Acyuta’
<div n="lb"/>have been found from Ahicchatra.<sup>16</sup> Therefore, it is possible
<div n="lb"/>that Ahicchatra was a seat of government of Acyutanandin.
<LEND>

<L>35<pc>041<k1>DanyavizRu<k2>DanyavizRu
2. {%Dhanyaviṣṇu%}¦ (No. 18, L. 8):
<div n="lb"/>He was the grandson of mahārāja Indraviṣṇu and younger
<div n="lb"/>brother of mahārāja Mātṛviṣṇu. We also find his name in line
<div n="lb"/>5 of the Eraṇ Stone Boar Inscription of the time of Toramāṇa
<div n="lb"/>(A.D. 500-515).<sup>17</sup> It signifies the tendency of naming persons
<div n="lb"/>by using adjectives before the names of deities. Dhanya means
<div n="lb"/>‘bringing or bestowing wealth or the opulent’.<sup>18</sup>
<LEND>

<L>36<pc>041<k1>harivizRu<k2>harivizRu
3. {%Hariviṣṇu%}¦ (No. 18, L. 6):
<div n="lb"/>He was the great-grandfather of mahārāja Mātṛviṣṇu. Hari
<div n="lb"/>here specifies the Kṛṣṇa apparition of Viṣṇu.<sup>19</sup>
<LEND>

<L>37<pc>041<k1>indravizRu<k2>indravizRu
4. {%Indraviṣṇu%}¦ (No. 18, L. 5):
<div n="lb"/>He has been mentioned as a mahārāja, great-grand-father of
<div n="lb"/>Mātṛviṣṇu; a brāhmaṇa devoted to studies and celebrating
<div n="lb"/>sacrifices and belonging to Maitrāyaṇīya (śākhā). The vedic
<div n="lb"/>counterpart is Indrāviṣṇū m. dual.
<LEND>

<L>38<pc>041<k1>matfvizRu<k2>matfvizRu
5. {%Matṛviṣṇu:%}¦ (No. 18, L. 7):
<div n="lb"/>He was the installer of the stone pillar at Eraṇ, a mahārāja,
<div n="lb"/>grandson of mahārāja Indraviṣṇu. We also find his name in
<div n="lb"/>the Eraṇ Stone Boar Inscription of the time of Toramāṇa
<div n="lb"/>(A.D. 500-515).<sup>20</sup> Mātṛ stands for one of the seven Mātṛ-
<div n="lb"/>kās<sup>21</sup> and may refer to the prevalence of the Mātṛ cult. The
<div n="lb"/>name is formed by the similar process of the combination of
<div n="lb"/>the names of two deities, Mātṛ and Viṣṇu. Mātṛ if taken as a
<div n="lb"/>short form for the Vedic Mātariśvan, together with Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>would mean Agni and Viṣṇu an interpretation that is relevant
<div n="lb"/>to the context.
<LEND>

<L>39<pc>041<k1>varuRavizRu<k2>varuRavizRu
6. {%Varuṇaviṣṇu%}¦ (No. 18, L. 5):
<div n="lb"/>He was the grandfather of mahārāja Mātṛviṣṇu. The name is
<div n="lb"/>based on the combination of the names of two deities Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>and Viṣṇu. Varuṇa is the sea-god of the Vedic pantheon.
<LEND>

<L>40<pc>041<k1>vizRudAsa<k2>vizRudAsa
7. {%Viṣṇudāsa%}¦ (No. 3, L. 2):
<div n="lb"/>Mahārāja Viṣṇudāsa belonged to the Sanakānīka family.
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu signifies the Lord Viṣṇu and dāsa means ‘a servant’.
<div n="lb"/>Thus the whole literally means ‘a servant or devotee of Lord
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu’.
<LEND>
[Page-042+ 36]

<L>41<pc>042<k1>vizRugopa<k2>vizRugopa
8. {%Viṣṇugopa%}¦ (No 1, L. 19):
<div n="lb"/>A ruler of Kāñcī. According to Diskalkar Viṣṇugopa is
<div n="lb"/>undoubtedly identical with an early Pallava king of that
<div n="lb"/>name.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="P"/>It can be a synonym of Lord Kṛṣṇa who originally an in-
<div n="lb"/>carnation of Viṣṇu took his birth as the son of Nanda who was
<div n="lb"/>a Gopa.
<LEND>
<div n="P"/>Now we study the names grouping them according to their
<div n="lb"/>suffixes.

<L>42<pc>042<k1>parRadatta<k2>parRadatta
1. {%Parṇadatta%}¦ (No. 14, L. 8, L. 9):
<div n="lb"/>He is mentioned as a ruler of Surāṣṭra appointed by Skanda-
<div n="lb"/>gupta. He was the father of governor Cakrapālita. Sankalia
<div n="lb"/>considers it to be an Iranian name.<sup>23</sup> But it can can very well
<div n="lb"/>be an Indian name. Parṇa means a leaf and is as well the name
<div n="lb"/>of a tree called Palāśa. We find ‘Parṇadatta’ to be the name
<div n="lb"/>of a man in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.<sup>24</sup> It signifies ‘a person
<div n="lb"/>born as a result of the worship of the Parṇa (Palāśa) tree’.
<LEND>

<L>43<pc>042<k1>svAmidatta<k2>svAmidatta
2. {%Svāmidatta%}¦<sup>25</sup> (No. 1, L. 19):
<div n="lb"/>He is mentioned as one of the Dakṣiṇāpatha kings. He was a
<div n="lb"/>ruler of Koṭṭūra and was defeated by Samudragupta.
<div n="P"/>Literally the name means ‘given by God’, the first part be-
<div n="lb"/>ing Svāmin and the second datta'.

<div n="lb"/>The first part is Mahendra, i.e., the great Indra and the second
<div n="lb"/>is ‘giri’, which means a mountain. It is also an honorific name
<div n="lb"/>later on given to one of the ten orders of the Das-nami Gosains
<div n="lb"/>(founded by ten pupils of Śaṅkarācārya; the word giri is added
<div n="lb"/>to the name of each member).<sup>27</sup> We also find it used with the

 {%Puṣyamitra%}¦ (No. 13, L. 11,):
<div n="lb"/>The name is mentioned in plural.<sup>28</sup> It is said that Puṣyamitras
[Page-043+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>who had developed great power and wealth were defeated by
<div n="lb"/>king Skandagupta.
<div n="P"/>The other readings suggested by scholars are Puṣpamitra
<div n="lb"/>and Yudhyamitra. But a careful scrutiny will support the
<div n="lb"/>reading Puṣyamitra as more likely. In the passages quoted by
<div n="lb"/>Bühler from the Prakrit Gāthās, ascribed to Merutuṅga,
<div n="lb"/>Dharmasāgara and Jayavijayāgni<sup>29</sup>, the name of the early
<div n="lb"/>king Puṣyamitra, the contemporary of Patañjali appears as
<div n="lb"/>Pusamitta and thus supports the reading Puṣyamitra.
<div n="P"/>Puṣyamitra in plural may denote the followers of king
<div n="lb"/>Puṣyamitra. Puṣyamitra, the name of a tribe in Central India,
<div n="lb"/>is also mentioned in the Purāṇas.

<div n="lb"/>Fleet fills up the lacuna<sup>30</sup> and takes Devarāja to be the
<div n="lb"/>name of an officer of Candragupta II.<sup>31</sup> But D.C. Sircar

<div n="P"/>Śikhara means a peak or summit of a mountain, hence the

<div n="lb"/>based on the river Gaṇḍakī can be given to a person just as the
<div n="lb"/>name Gaṅgā based on the river Ganges is given to a person.
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇḍaka is also the name of the Videhas living on the river
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇḍakī<sup>89</sup> and also refers to a rhinoceros.<sup>90</sup> It is possible

<div n="lb"/>The first part of the name Śāmba is to be derived from {%Sāmba%}

<div n="lb"/>the name of Lord Śiva.<sup>12</sup> It has been the name of a son of

<div n="lb"/>{%Pāla%} is a name-ending suffix having the least significance in the

<div n="lb"/>going a change in usage with the Gujarati-speaking people and

<div n="lb"/>people.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="P"/>Devabhaṭṭa was a brāhmaṇa. He was an inhabitant of

[Page-090+ 39]
<div n="P"/>The name ‘Ḍaḍḍa’, ‘Ḍuḍḍa’ or ‘Ḍuḍḍā’<sup>14</sup> cannot be
<div n="lb"/>derived from any Sanskrit root. Nor are these names found
<div n="lb"/>in any Sanskrit or Prakrit dictionary. Dr. H.D. Sankalia
<div n="lb"/>suggests that these names were derived from the Sanskrit
<div n="lb"/>term Dardara,<sup>15</sup> meaning ‘a mountain’, or a region having
<div n="lb"/>holes or ravines. The man may have shifted from a hilly
<div n="lb"/>region.
<div n="P"/>We find references to geographical names like ‘Daddara-
<div n="lb"/>pabbata’ and ‘Mahādaddara’ in the Daddara Jātaka.<sup>16</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>{%Daddarapabbata%} may be identified with the mountainous tract
<div n="lb"/>of Dardistan, lying to the north-west of Kashmir, and south
<div n="lb"/>of Little Pamir. Since the river Sindhu after its origin in the
<div n="lb"/>Himalayas near Tibet flows through this country, Pāṇini calls
<div n="lb"/>the river {%Dāradī Sindhuḥ.%}<sup>17</sup>
<div n="P"/>The people of this tract, the {%Daradas%} are mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata in the list of the foreign tribes which sprang up
<div n="lb"/>along with the Yavanas, Mlecchas and Śakas, from the cow
<div n="lb"/>Kāmadhenu, when she was being forcibly driven away by
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra from Vasiṣṭha's {%āśrama.<sup>18</sup>%} The Daradas are the
<div n="lb"/>people, living above Peshawar.<sup>19</sup> But the basic weakness in the
<div n="lb"/>suggestion made by Dr. H.D. Sankalia<sup>20</sup> is, as he himself
<div n="lb"/>admits, these names are not found in any Sanskrit or Prakrit
<div n="lb"/>dictionary.
<div n="P"/>It may be noted that the words Ḍoḍa and Ḍoḍḍa are syno-
<div n="lb"/>nyms used for a brāhmaṇa and Ḍoḍiṇī stands for a brāhmaṇī,
<div n="lb"/>or a brāhmaṇa-woman.<sup>21</sup> These are deśya words and hence
<div n="lb"/>refer to local elements.
<div n="P"/>In Punjabi language a person who is very simple or credu-
<div n="lb"/>lous or who can be very easily cheated is called ‘Ḍoḍa’. It is
<div n="lb"/>not unlikely that on account of his pious ways and bookish
<div n="lb"/>approach a brāhmaṇa was generally taken to be a simple
<div n="lb"/>person. In the Sanskrit story books the picture of a typical
<div n="lb"/>brāhmaṇa is that of a simpleton who can be easily duped.
<div n="lb"/>Hence it is possible that a brāhmaṇa was called ‘Ḍoḍa’ and
<div n="lb"/>the feminine form of ‘Ḍoḍa’ (i. e. Ḍoḍiṇī) was used for a
<div n="lb"/>brāhmaṇa-womaṇ.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="P"/>In Karnataka ‘Ḍoḍḍu’ means ‘big’ or elder. {%‘Ḍoḍḍācārya’%}
<div n="lb"/>or {%‘Ḍuḍḍācārya’%} a term of respect for a learned Paṇḍita is also
<div n="lb"/>used in satire.

<L>298<pc>096<k1>bali<k2>bali
1. {%Bali%}¦ (No. 14, L. 2):
<div n="lb"/>The reference to Bali comes in connection with the praise of
<div n="lb"/>Lord Viṣṇu.<sup>57</sup> Literally meaning ‘one who is powerful or
<div n="lb"/>vigorous’, Bali was the son of Virocana and the grandson of
<div n="lb"/>Prahlāda and has been the king of the Asuras.<sup>58</sup> A famous
<div n="lb"/>legend about him runs thus — The demon Bali, by his austeri-
<div n="lb"/>ties acquired the dominion over the three worlds, and caused
<div n="lb"/>annoyance and anxiety to the gods. Viṣṇu then reincarnated
<div n="lb"/>himself as a dwarf, appeared before Bali, and asked for as
<div n="lb"/>much land as he could cover with three strides. Bali assented
<div n="lb"/>to his request, and Viṣṇu with two strides covered the heavens
<div n="lb"/>and the earth, but, in commiseration for Bali, who then
<div n="lb"/>humbled himself, left him the dominion over the lower
<div n="lb"/>regions below the earth.<sup>59</sup> We get a reference to this legend
<div n="lb"/>as early as in the Viṣṇusūkta of the Ṛgveda.<sup>60</sup>

2. {%Buddha%}¦ (No. 23, LL. 6-7):
<div n="lb"/>He has been given the epithet ‘The Divine’ (Bhagavān Buddha).
<div n="lb"/>He is mentioned in connection with a Buddhist temple. Literally
<div n="lb"/>the name means awakened, conscious or intelligent. For
<div n="lb"/>Buddhists it stands for a fully enlightened man who has
<div n="lb"/>achieved perfect knowledge of the truth and thereby is liberated
<div n="lb"/>from all existence and before his own attainment of Nirvāṇa
<div n="lb"/>reveals the method of obtaining it. The principal Buddha of
<div n="lb"/>the present age was born at Kapilavastu in the year 566 B.C.<sup>61</sup>
<div n="lb"/>His father Śuddhodana was the Rājā of that district. His
<div n="lb"/>mother was Māyādevī, and his original name was Siddhārtha.
<div n="lb"/>He belonged to the Kṣatriya Śākya tribe, while Gautama
<div n="lb"/>seems to refer to the race to which his family belonged. He
<div n="lb"/>had left his home in quest of truth and after a concentrated
[Page-097+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>meditation for a few years attained the discovery of truths
<div n="lb"/>and was called the Buddha or the enlightened.<sup>62</sup>

3. {%Kṛṣṇa%}¦ (No. 13, L. 13):
<div n="lb"/>It is a name based on colour, meaning black-dark, dark-blue.
<div n="lb"/>“Vasudeva, a descendant of Yadu and Yayāti, had by his
<div n="lb"/>second wife Devakī, eight sons of whom the last, Kṛṣṇa, was
<div n="lb"/>born with black-skin and a peculiar mark on his breast”.<sup>63</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Yaśodā was Kṛṣṇa's foster-mother to whom he was shifted in
<div n="lb"/>Gokula or Vraja immediately after his birth to escape the
<div n="lb"/>cruel hands of Kaṃsa. In our inscription Skandagupta has been
<div n="lb"/>compared with Lord Kṛṣṇa, who after slaying his enemy
<div n="lb"/>Kaṃsa had returned to his mother Devakī.<sup>64</sup>

<div n="lb"/>In No. 17, king Viśvavarman is compared with Pārtha in
<div n="lb"/>(heroic) deeds of war. In No. 19 Bhānugupta is described as
<div n="lb"/>a mighty king equal to Pārtha, exceedingly heroic. Pārtha is
<div n="lb"/>formed from Pṛthā and is a metronymic for Arjuna who has
<div n="lb"/>been mentioned in the Purāṇas, as the husband of Subhadrā
<div n="lb"/>and father of Abhimanyu.<sup>65</sup>

5. {%Pṛthu%}¦ (No. 2, LL. 7-8):
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta is stated to have surpassed the kings like
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthu and Rāghava in giving gold. Literally Pṛthu means
<div n="lb"/>broad, wide, expansive, extensive, spacious or large.<sup>66</sup>
<div n="P"/>About nineteen Pṛthus have been mentioned in the Purāṇas,<sup>67</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the most important and famous being the Vainya. Here the
<div n="lb"/>reference seems to this Pṛthu, the Vainya.
<div n="P"/>He is the son of Vena got out of by the churning his
<div n="lb"/>right arm by the sages to save him from falling into hell
<div n="lb"/>and is considered the ninth incarnation of Hari. He was the
<div n="lb"/>first king who introduced agriculture. Due to scarcity of
<div n="lb"/>supply when people complained of hunger, he armed his
<div n="lb"/>arrow and the earth was milked. Hilly tracts were levelled
<div n="lb"/>and different kinds of villages, cities and towns were organised
<div n="lb"/>for the first time. Pṛthu has been panegyrised by the Gandhar-
<div n="lb"/>vas, and Siddhas playing on different musical instruments.<sup>68</sup>

<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta is mentioned to have surpassed the kings like
<div n="lb"/>Pṛthu and Rāghava in giving gold.<sup>69</sup> Rāghava literally means
<div n="lb"/>a descendant of Raghu,<sup>70</sup> and is used as a patronymic of Aja,
[Page-098+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>of Daśaratha and of Rāmacandra. In dual number (rāghavau)
<div n="lb"/>it refers to Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.<sup>71</sup>

<div n="lb"/>He is mentioned in these inscriptions as a donor of lands.<sup>72</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Literally Sagara means ‘containing poison or poisonous’
<div n="lb"/>It is the name of a king of the solar race, sovereign of Ayodhyā,
<div n="lb"/>son of Bāhu. He is said to have been called Sa-gara, as born
<div n="lb"/>together with a poison administered to his mother by the co-
<div n="lb"/>wives of her husband. He was father of Asamañjasa by Keśinī
<div n="lb"/>and of sixty thousand sons by Sumati; the latter were turned
<div n="lb"/>into a heap of ashes by the sage Kapila, and their funeral
<div n="lb"/>ceremonies could only be performed by the waters of Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>to be brought from heaven for the purpose of purifying their
<div n="lb"/>remains; this was finally accomplished by Bhagīratha.<sup>73</sup>

<div n="lb"/>43, L. 30; No. 44, L. 21; No. 52, LL. 11-12):
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa has been mentioned as Bhagavān (venerable) Vyāsa in
<div n="lb"/>No. 28; as Dvaipāyana in No. 29 and as Vedavyāsa in No. 44.
<div n="lb"/>In No. 43, there is a reference to his saying in the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata.<sup>74</sup> In No. 52 he is described as the compiler of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedas and as a son of Parāśara.<sup>75</sup>
<div n="P"/>Literally Vyāsa means ‘division or extension’ and as the
<div n="lb"/>name of a person it signifies an arranger, complier or narrator.
<div n="lb"/>Vyāsa is said to have rearranged the Vedas into four parts,
<div n="lb"/>and taught each of them to four respective pupils — Paila,
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśaṃpāyana, Jaimini and Sumantu; he also rearranged
<div n="lb"/>Itihāsa — Purāṇas and composed the Bhārata and the Bhāga-
<div n="lb"/>vata.<sup>76</sup> Subsequently, the name Vyāsa came to be applied to
<div n="lb"/>any great typical compiler or author.<sup>77</sup> He was the son of the
<div n="lb"/>sage Parāśara and was brought forth by his mother Satyavatī
<div n="lb"/>on an island in the river Yamunā. Hence he is also known
<div n="lb"/>as Dvaipāyana and Bādarāyaṇa.<sup>78</sup> As he was called Kṛṣṇa-
<div n="lb"/>Dvaipāyana, it seems that Vyāsa, Dvaipāyana, and Bādarāyaṇa
<div n="lb"/>were epithets; his original name might have been Kṛṣṇa due to
<div n="lb"/>his dark complexion,<sup>79</sup> and he was called ‘Dvaipāyana for
<div n="lb"/>being born on an island ({%dvīpa%}).’

<>tion or school of learning. After his death his name was associated with

<>to extend from sixth or seventh century before Christ to about the second

<>form in the long interval from the fifth century B.C. to A.D. 400. But the first

<div n="lb"/>to the original meaning. It explains {%‘Dāman’%} as {%‘Sandānam’,%}

<div n="lb"/>that the name of Skandagupta's mother was Devakī and he

<div n="lb"/>Sircar the simile may further suggest that some maternal uncle
<div n="lb"/>of Skandagupta actually fought against him in support of his
<div n="lb"/>rival and that his mother, possibly not the chief queen of his

<H>CONCLUSION
<>We may review our discussion before we conclude as follows:
<H>{%Names of the Gupta kings%}
<P>Among the names of the Gupta kings ‘Gupta’ is an example
<>of an abbreviated name. Chaṭotkaca. Chaṭotkacagupta, Pūru-
<>gupta and Vainyagupta are the Epic names. Budhagupta is a
<>{%nakṣatra-nāma%} (name based on constellation). Bhānugupta is a
<>name based on the Sun god.
<P>Govindagupta, Narasiṃhgupta and Viṣṇugupta are Vaiṣṇa-
<>vite names. Candragupta (I), Samudragupta, Candragupta (II),
<>Kumāragupta (I), Skandagupta, Kumāragupta (II) and Kumāra-
<>gupta (III) are Śaivite names. The names of Skandagupta and
<>Kumāragupta exhibit the popularity of the war-god Skanda or
<>Kārttikeya.<sup>18</sup>
<P>The names Candragupta and Kumārgupta were repeated in
<>the Gupta family which is against the Mahābhāṣya rule<sup>19</sup> that
<>the first part of the name can be borrowed from one of the
<>three male ancestors but the second part of the name should
<>be different. It may be said that the repetition of the second
<>part could not be avoided due to the tendency of the Guptas
<>to add to their names the termination ‘Gupta’ which had
<>almost become their family name.
<H>{%Names of the Gupta queens%}
<P>Among the names of the Gupta Queens Kumāradevī,
<>Anantadevī, Candradevī, Śrīvatsadevī and Mitradevī were
<>after gods. In Dattadevī, the name-ending termination ‘datta’
<>forms the first part of the name. The name Dhruvadevī or
<>Dhruvasvāminī was based on {%Dhruva%} (polar star). This was
<>against Smṛti injunctions. Manu says that a brāhmaṇa should
<>not marry a maiden who bears the name of a constellation,
<>tree or river, of a low caste, of a mountain, of a bird, snake
[Page-107+ 38]
<>or slave, or of anything terrifying.<sup>20</sup> The names of women
<>derived from the names of the {%nakṣatras%} are forbidden by the
<>Dharmasūtras.<sup>21</sup>
<P>Devī meaning goddess is the common termination in all the
<>names except Dhruvasvāminī which ends in Svāminī meaning
<>‘mistress’.
<P>It is interesting to note that Kāmarūpa king Puṣyavarman's
<>son Samudravarman was named after the Gupta king Samudra-
<>gupta. Moreover, Samudravarman's queen took the same name
<>as that of the queen of Samudragupta, i. e. Dattadevī.<sup>22</sup> Barua
<>considers Samudravarman to be the contemporary of Candra-
<>gupta II, Vikramāditya and the celebrated poet Kālidāsa.<sup>23</sup>
<P>We also take into account the other feminine names which
<>are as follows:
<P>(i) Dāmasvāminī
<P>(ii) Devakī
<P>(iii) Harisvāminī
<P>(iv) Padmāvatī
<P>(v) Rāmī
<P>(vi) Sābhāṭi
<P>(vii) Śāmāḍhyā
<P>In feminine names we notice the terminations svāminī and
<>vatī. We find that the feminine names in our inscriptions
<>generally end in {%‘ī’.%}
<P>Now we classify the names according to the deities they
<>represent. Some names were used by more than one person
<>and somehow seem to have been popular. As they appear in
<>more than one inscription and for different individuals we have
<>listed them separately.

<P>In order to determine the prevalence of Śaivite names we

<>on god Moon are Bhaṭṭisoma, Īśvaracandra, Prabhucandra,
<>Śaśinandin, Svāmicandra, Somapāla, Candravarmman, Candra-
<>gupta (I) and (II), queen Candradevī and Suraśmicandra.

<>Though Kṛṣṇa is an incarnation of Viṣṇu<sup>24</sup>, for determining
<>the currency of names based on Viṣṇu directly, we will not
<>count names based on Kṛṣṇa.
<P>Lord Rāma is believed to be the seventh incarnation of Viṣṇu.
<>Rāma occurring in our inscriptions seems to have been Rāma
<>Rāghava. The names based on Rāma are given below:
<H>{%Names based on Rāma%}
<P>1. Lakṣmaṇaśarmman
<P>2. Rāmasvāmin
<P>3. Rāghava
<P>4. Rāmī
<P>5. Lakṣmaṇa
<P>6. Rāmadāsa
<P>7. Rāma
<P>8. Rāmaka
<P>9. Rāmaśarmman
<P>Other minor deities of the period which emerge out from
<>an analysis of the proper names are as follows:
<H>{%Names based on Nāga%}
<P>1. Nāgadeva
<P>2. Rājyanāga
<P>3. Vīranāga
<P>4. Sarppapālita
<P>5. Ahiśarmman
<P>6. Nāgaśarmman
<P>7. Bhaṭanandin
<P>8. Nāgadatta
[Page-112+ 37]
<P>9. Āmrakārddava
<P>10. Nāgasena
<P>11. Anantadevī
<H>{%Names based on Indra%}
<P>1. Puraṃdara
<P>2. Jayanandin
<P>3. Mahendragiri
<P>4. Devarāja
<P>5. Indraviṣṇu
<H>{%Names based on Sun%}
<P>1. Bhāskara
<P>2. Ādityabandhu
<P>3. Divākaranandin
<P>4. Arkkadāsa
<P>5. Ravila
<P>6. Prabhākara
<P>7. Devabhaṭṭāraka
<P>8. Bhānugupta
<P>9. Mitradevī
<P>The only name based on Goddess Durgā is ‘Durgādatta’.
<P>The two names based on Mātṛ cult (seven Mātṛkas)
<>follow:
<P>1. Mātṛdāsa
<P>2. Mātṛviṣṇu
<P>There is only one name based on god Varuṇa (Sea-god),
<>which is Varuṇaviṣṇu.
<P>The names based on Nara form of God are Nārāyaṇadāsa,
<>Naradeva and Nara-Nandin.
<P>We find that both the Śaivite and Vaiṣṇavite names are
<>almost equal in number. If we delete the names of allied deities
<>we get about 51 Śaivite names and 44 Vaiṣṇavite names.
<>Thus Śaivite names seem to be more popular. An indication of
<>the leaning of the Gupta kings towards Vaiṣṇavism is clear
<>from the Garuḍa emblem of the Guptas.<sup>25</sup> The gupta monarchs
<>also used the title ‘Paramabhāgavata’ i. e.; the devout devotee
<>of Viṣṇu, in their imperial records. Majority of the names of
<>Guptas show a preference for Śaivism. We know from the
[Page-113+ 39]
<>Mathurā Pillar Inscription of the year 61 (No. 41) about the
<>Lakulīśa sect of the Pāśupatas which was very popular at
<>Mathurā. Kuśika one of the four main disciples of its founder
<>Lakulīśa who is regarded as the last incarnation of Śiva finds
<>mention in this record. Parāśara, Upamita, Kapila and Udita
<>were the Pāśupata teachers, who flourished in the Gupta
<>period. We know of the prevalence of the worship of goddess
<>Durgā and Śiva's two sons, Kārttikeya and Gaṇeśa. There are
<>two names based on Cupid (god of love) which are Ratibhadra
<>and Māraviṣa. The popularity of Nāga worship in the Gupta
<>period known from other sources is confirmed by an analysis
<>of the names. Other categories of names are Buddhist and Jaina
<>names which also indicate popularity of Hindu sects to some
<>extent. They are as follows:
<P>1. Abhayamitra
<P>2. Guhanandin
<P>3. Gośarmman
<P>4. Jitasena
<P>5. Dat(tt)ilācārya
<P>6. Pārśva
<P>7. Buddhamitra
<P>8. Bhaṭṭibhava
<P>9. Bhaṭṭisoma
<P>10. Bhadra
<P>11. Madra
<P>12. Rudrasoma
<P>13. Śaṃkara
<P>14. Śāntideva
<P>15. Sanasiddha
<P>16. Somila
<P>17. Buddha
<P>18. Saṃghiladeva
<P>19. Saṃghila
<P>A large number of names discussed by us reveal an incli-
<>nation towards Śaivism. Bühler had already proved from the
<>date of the Sāñcī Stūpa Inscriptions that the worship of Viṣṇu
<>and Śiva is older than Buddhism and Jainism. It can be gues-
<>sed that the donors mentioned in the records or their ancestors
<>adhered to these creeds before their conversion and that they
[Page-114+ 39]
<>received their names in accordance with the established customs
<>of their families.<sup>26</sup>
<P>We also find some Epic and Puranic names which show
<>the popularity of the Epics and the Purāṇas. The names are:
<P>1. Ghaṭotkaca
<P>2. Ghaṭotkacagupta
<P>3. Pūrugupta
<P>4. Vainyagupta
<P>5. Pārtha
<P>6. Pṛthu
<P>7. Vyāsa
<P>8. Yudhiṣṭhira
<P>9. Bhīma
<P>10. Dhanañjaya
<P>11. Sagara
<P>12. Parāśara
<P>Another considerable group of proper names is derived
<>from the names of Nakṣatras. This shows that the rule in the
<>Gṛhyasūtras recommending the use of Nakṣatra names, was
<>obeyed. These names are as follows:
<P>1. Puṣyamitra
<P>2. Dhruvaśarman
<P>3. Dhruvadevī, Dhruvasvāminī (against the rules in case
<>of women)
<P>4. Budhagupta
<P>Madra and Khāsaka are the two names which may be termed
<>as tribal names, presumably pointing to the tribes to which
<>they belonged.
<P>Names based on colour are (1) Kālaka, (2) Kapila, (3)
<>Piṅgala and (4) Nīlarāja.
<P>The names based on animals are Siṃhaha(da)tta, Siṃha-
<>nandin, Gaṇḍa, Śarabharāja, Vyāghrarāja, Hastivarmman,
<>Chagalaga and Śaṇḍaka.
<P>The names based on abstract qualities are: (1) Bhadradeva
<>Kāmanakuṇḍa, Rūpaśarmman, Suśarmman, Bandhumitra,
<>Amṛtadeva, Śāmāḍhyā, Ribhupāla, Dhṛtimitra, Matidatta,
<>Kṣemadatta, Balavarmman, Dhruvabhūti, Matila, and Vīrasena.
<>We can also classify the names into two categories, Sanskrit
<>and non-Sanskrit or Prakrit names. A few of the second group
[Page-115+ 39]
<>may be enumerated here:
<P>1. Piccakuṇḍa
<P>2. Prabhamitra
<P>3. Kaṅkuṭi
<P>4. Bonda
<P>5. Vailinaka
<P>6. Karppaṭika
<P>7. Riśidatta
<P>8. Rāmī
<P>9. Ḍuḍika
<P>10. Līḍhaka
<P>The names of brāhmaṇas occurring in our inscriptions
<>sometimes end in a non-brāhmaṇic cognomen such as Bhaṭṭa,
<>Datta and Kuṇḍa, etc., which are available in the inscrip-
<>tions of Bengal. Surnames like Datta, Dāma, Pālita, Pāla,
<>Kuṇḍa (Kuṇḍu), Dāsa, Nāga and Nandin are now confined
<>to Kāyasthas of Bengal but not to brāhmaṇas. Bhandarkar<sup>27</sup>
<>has pointed out that identical surnames are used by the
<>Nāgara-brāhmaṇas. It cannot be said definitely whether the
<>name-endings in dāman occurring in the names of several
<>Śaka satraps portraying Iranian influence<sup>28</sup> have any relation-
<>ship with the name-ending {%‘dāman’%} found in our records.
<P>Noticing brāhmaṇic names with a large number of modern
<>Bengali Kāyastha cognomens in several early epigraphs
<>discovered in Bengal, some scholars have suggested that there
<>is a considerable brāhmaṇa element in the present day Kāyastha
<>community of Bengal. Originally the professions of Kāyastha
<>(scribe) and Vaidya (physician) were not restricted and could
<>be followed by people of different {%Varṇas%} including the
<>brāhmaṇas. So there is every probability that a number of
<>brāhmaṇa families were mixed up with members of other
<>Varṇas in forming the present Kāyastha and Vaidya commu-
<>nities of Bengal. <sup>29</sup>
<P>Kāyasthas frequently figure in our inscriptions usually
<>as professional writers. The office of Kāyastha (scribe) seems
<>to have been instituted before the beginning of Gupta period.
<>It seems likely that they had not developed into a caste during
<>our period. “This may account for the non-reference to them
<>as a caste in the contemporary Smṛtis”.<sup>30</sup> Majumdar<sup>31</sup> says
[Page-116+ 42]
<>that the Gupta emperors were vaiśyas but this is wrong, as we
<>have shown that they were certainly non-vaiśyas.
<P>Professions were not determined rigidly according to caste.
<>We find in our records that some brāhmaṇas followed non-
<>brāhmaṇical professions. Likewise some kṣatriyas followed
<>non-kṣatriya professions. We find in the Eran Stone Pillar
<>Inscription of Budhagupta, of the year 165 (No. 18) that
<>Mātṛviṣṇu, a brāhmaṇa, was a feudatory of the Guptas in
<>Central India. Indraviṣṇu, and Varuṇaviṣṇu the great grand-
<>father and grand-father respectively of the donor are described
<>as pious brāhmaṇas who were engaged in spiritual and religious
<>pursuits. In the Inscription the heroic and victorious character
<>of Mātṛviṣṇu is stated. From the Indor Copper Plate Inscrip-
<>tion of Skandagupta of the year 146 (No. 16), we come to
<>know that two kṣatriyas Acalavarman and Bhrukuṇṭhasiṃha
<>were merchants of the town of Indrapura in U.P.

<H>PART TWO
<>NAMES OF THE TRIBES
[Page-120+ 1]
<>Blank
[Page-121+ 32]
<H>Prologue
<P>Tribal Names occurring in our records make it clear that
<>they represented a heterogeneous stock of people in Indian
<>society and that ethnic or geographical factors predominated.
<>The locality or country was generally known by the plural of
<>the tribal name. The original name of the tribe whether
<>ethnic or territorial may be hypothetical since it is difficult
<>to determine exactly whether the place gave the name to
<>the tribe or the tribe to the place. We find many exam-
<>ples where the tribes gave their names to the places after
<>they were known by some ethnic or tribal appellations. For
<>example, we know that Videha obtained its name from the
<>settlement of the Videgha tribe who were lead by their king
<>Māthava when they pushed forward to the east from the
<>Sarasvatī<sup>1</sup> and that Pāñcāla denoted the country or kingdom
<>which the Kṣatriya tribe Pañcāla occupied.<sup>2</sup> With a definite
<>territory of their own, they lost their tribal character and
<>assumed the functions of the ruler. The names of the janapadas
<>thus given continued even if the tribe migrated somewhere
<>else; rather it gave the names to the janapadas wherever it
<>settled. Thus we know the divisions of the Mālavas, Yaudhe-
<>yas, the Kurus and the Madras.
<P>These tribes went through various vicissitudes due to
<>the growth of big imperial states viz. of the Mauryas and
<>the Guptas, and foreigns invasions from the north-west. They
<>had replaced old Vedic tribes in many places and flourished
<>during the period from 6th century B.C. to A.D. 4th-5th
<>century. Though Altekar<sup>3</sup> has pointed out that they flourished
<>only in north-western and north-eastern zone and conspic-
<>uously absented themselves in the south, we find the evi-
<>dence of self-governing people, though scanty, in South
<>India as well. The Rock Edict XIII refers to some territories
[Page-122+ 39]
<>in the south which are mentioned as a people and not as
<>kingdoms.<sup>4</sup> Not only that the Satiyaputras and the Kerala-
<>putras are also mentioned in the Second Rock Edict of Aśoka.<sup>5</sup>
<P>We find some tribes known probably after proper names
<>viz., the Yaudheyas and Ārjunāyanas as well as the proper
<>names used after the tribes.<sup>6</sup> We also know of Madra as a
<>personal name in our records. K.P. Jayaswal has pointed out
<>that the śūdra republic is evidently the same whom Alexander
<>met in lower Sind and whom ‘we have identified with the
<>brahminical Śaudras or Śaudrāyaṇas of the Gaṇapāṭha’. On
<>grammar it is based on the proper name (of a man) śūdra,
<>not the caste-name.<sup>7</sup>
<P>The tribes did not live in isolation and interacted with
<>society. The bond that held so heterogeneous a society together,
<>made it a society rather than a set of tribes, was not so much
<>common ritual and common language but as a whole it was an
<>aggregate of common needs satisfied by reciprocal exchange.
<P>The indigenous tribes based on caste and family founded
<>the republican kingdoms. They worked singularly or formed
<>confederations to save themselves from foreign aggressions.
<>The republics had emerged from the Vedic tribes and retained
<>much more tribal tradition than did the monarchies. In the
<>transition from tribe to republic they lost the essential demo-
<>cratic pattern of the tribe but retained the idea of government
<>through an assembly representing the tribe.<sup>8</sup> Tribal organiza-
<>tion was based on a smaller geographical area and permitted
<>the functioning of a popular government more effectively.<sup>9</sup>
<P>The words Saṃgha and Gaṇa have been synonymously used
<>for these republics. Pāṇini makes frequent use of the word
<>Saṃgha in his Aṣṭādhyāyī. It seems later the word Saṃgha
<>became representative of the Buddhist order and hence the use
<>of the term was dropped for a republic and only the word
<>‘Gaṇa’ was retained for the purpose.<sup>10</sup>
<P>The Āyudhajīvin republics of Pāṇini had become {%Vārtā-%}
<>{%śāstropajīvins%} by the time of Kauṭilya, probably they had
<>taken to agriculture and industry side by side with their
<>common profession of military art. They are enumerated by
<>Kauṭilya as the Kambojas, the Surāṣṭras, the Kṣatriyas, the
<>Śreṇis, and ‘others’.<sup>11</sup> The other class of republics bore the
[Page-123+ 39]
<>title Rājan or king, are as follows: The Licchavikas, the Vṛjikas,
<>the Mallakas, the Madrakas, the Kukuras, the Kurus, the
<>Pāñcālas, and ‘others’.<sup>12</sup> Basham opines that the Arthaśāstra
<>refers ironically to the martial arrogance and practical ineptitude
<>of the republics when it mentions the members of the seven
<>named tribes “making a living by the title of {%rājā%}”.<sup>13</sup>
<P>We do not agree with Basham since we know from a
<>passage in the later Vedic literature that the Uttarakurus and
<>the Uttaramadras were kingless ({%vairājya%}) states, where
<>people, the heads of founder families, were consecrated
<>for the rulership.<sup>14</sup> Kauṭilya has also placed the Madrakas
<>and the Kurus along with the Licchavis. We can compare them
<>with the Licchavis whose 7,707 members, probably the
<>descendants of the founder members of the privileged aristo-
<>cracy, who were all entitled to the honorific title {%rājā.%}<sup>15</sup> At a
<>certain time while dealing with the history of republican tribes
<>in India some extravagant claims were made by some scholars
<>like K.P. Jayaswal who wrote under nationalistic predilections
<>to prove that not only a constitutional form of Government,
<>but the entire parliamentary system, including Address to the
<>Throne and Voting of grants, was prevalent in India and that
<>responsible Government, with all that it implies in the West,
<>existed in ancient India with its full paraphernalia.<sup>16</sup>
<P>It may be mentioned that these republics were not demo-
<>cracies in the modern sense of the term where franchise is
<>vested in as large a number of citizens as possible. We find
<>that some of them had mixed constitutions, while others were
<>transforming themselves to monarchy. Some of them may even
<>be termed as oligarchies. We can call them Kṣatriya aristo-
<>cracies where the power was vested in the hands of consecrated
<>Kṣatriyas ({%Mūrdhābhiṣikta%}).
<P>Pāṇini<sup>17</sup> distinguishes between the Mālavas or Kṣudrakas
<>and the Mālavyas and Kṣudrakyas respectively. The former
<>denoted the Kṣatriya and brāhmaṇa aristocracy while the
<>latter the common folk. Similarly the Amarakośa distinguishes
<>between the {%Rājanayaka gaṇa%} and the {%rājaka-gaṇa.%} In the
<>former the power was vested in the descendants of the original
<>founder families enjoying the title of the {%rājā;%} whereas in the
<>case of latter it was vested in all the Kṣatriya families whether
[Page-124+ 30]
<>descended from the original founders or not.<sup>18</sup>
<P>But the {%Gaṇa%} indicated a certain type of state, sharply
<>distinguished from monarchy, is proved by a reference from
<>the Avadānaśataka where it is narrated that when some mer-
<>chants from Madhyadeśa, travelling in the Deccan, were asked
<>by a local ruler as to who the kings were in their respective
<>homelands, they replied, ‘Sir, in the countries of some of us
<>there are kings but in those of others, there is gaṇa or republican
<>government’.<sup>19</sup> That gaṇa had a definite constitutional
<>meaning is also supported by the evidence from the Jain
<>literature, the coin-legends of the Yaudheyas, Mālavas and
<>Ārjunāyanas as well as by the writings of the contemporary
<>Greek writers.<sup>20</sup>
<P>It may be admitted that the ancient Indian republics were
<>regular states and not mere territories marked for different tribes.
<>They had crossed the tribal stage and had adopted the monar-
<>chical system or were transforming themselves to republicanism
<>or had mixed constitutions. They were small territorial units.
<>They issued their own coins and the coin-legends in Sanskrit.
<>It proves beyond doubt that they got Aryanized. They had weak
<>economy and followed their copper or silver coinage rather
<>than the gold currency system which had its start with Kaniṣka
<>in Northern India. In the time of distress or as a friendly
<>gesture, they worked as auxiliary armies to the kings. Though
<>at times tributary to the great kingdoms, they exercised
<>internal autonomy.
<P>Even when they migrated to other lands, it is not necessary
<>that the whole population migrated, a majority of them might
<>have succumbed to the onslaughts of the invader or got merged
<>with the dominant tribe.

1. {%Ābhīra%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
<div n="lb"/>They were one of the tribes subdued by Samudragupta.
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīras lived to the north of the Rajaputana desert. We may
<div n="lb"/>also think of Abiravan between Herat and Kandahar which
<div n="lb"/>may have been the original home of the Ābhīras. In the 3rd
<div n="lb"/>century A.D. there was an Ābhīra kingdom in the north-
<div n="lb"/>western Deccan.<sup>21</sup> D.C. Sircar<sup>22</sup> describes Ābhīra in singular as
<div n="lb"/>a member of the Cowherd Community. The tribe can still be
<div n="lb"/>traced in the present Ahīras,<sup>23</sup> who in tribal groups, abound
<div n="lb"/>largely in the Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Nepal and some portions
<div n="lb"/>of Rajasthan. They are a band of simple, sturdy people,
<div n="lb"/>mostly cowherds and agriculturists.<sup>24</sup> This tribe<sup>25</sup> is thought to
<div n="lb"/>have played a big part in the propagation of the worship of
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa Govinda<sup>26</sup> in his pastoral aspect.
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhārata<sup>27</sup> places the Ābhīras in West Rajasthan
<div n="lb"/>‘where the Sarasvatī disappears’.
<div n="P"/>In the first and second centuries A.D. they are located in
<div n="lb"/>the country between the lower Sindhu valley and Kathiawar,
<div n="lb"/>as is indicated in the ‘Periplus’ and in the Geography of
<div n="lb"/>Ptolemy.<sup>28</sup> The Periplus calls their country Abiria. Ābhīra
<div n="lb"/>generals served in the armics of Śaka Kṣatraps of Western
<div n="lb"/>India in the second century A.D. as is known from their
<div n="lb"/>inscriptions.<sup>29</sup> They are also mentioned in the Mahābhāṣya
<div n="lb"/>of Patañjali<sup>30</sup> in association with the Śūdras, the Sodrai of
<div n="lb"/>Alexander's time, who lived in northern Sind. Throughout
<div n="lb"/>the third century A.D. the Ābhīras exercised ruling power in
<div n="lb"/>northern Konkan and Mahārāshtra.<sup>31</sup> Vātsyāyana<sup>32</sup> refers to
<div n="lb"/>the Harem of the Ābhīra kings. The Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa<sup>33</sup>
[Page-126+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>and the Vāyu Purāṇa<sup>34</sup> refer to them as ‘Dakṣiṇāpatha-vāsinaḥ’
<div n="lb"/>or dwelling in the Southern Country. The Bṛhat-saṃhitā<sup>35</sup>
<div n="lb"/>mentions them as being under the jurisdiction of Śani
<div n="lb"/>(Saturn).
<div n="P"/>The Jodhpur Inscription of Saṃvat 918, records that the
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīra people of this area were a terror to their neighbours,
<div n="lb"/>because of their violent demeanour.<sup>36</sup> The Ābhīra robbers are
<div n="lb"/>also mentioned in the Skanda Purāṇa.<sup>37</sup> Epigraphic evidence
<div n="lb"/>indicates the existence of an Ābhīra kingdom in the 14th
<div n="lb"/>Century in Khandesh.<sup>38</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Sāhitya Darpaṇa of Viśvanātha,<sup>39</sup> it is stated that
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīrī is the language of the Ābhīras and Cāṇḍālī of the
<div n="lb"/>Caṇḍālas. Those who do woodwork can speak Ābhīrī or Śābarī,
<div n="lb"/>either of the two. Daṇḍin asserts that the speeches of the
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīras, etc., are termed as Apabhraṃśa in the Kāvya<sup>40</sup> on
<div n="lb"/>the basis of which probably Keith writes: “the Prakrit lyrics
<div n="lb"/>passed into Apabhraṃśa as a result of the activities of the
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīras and the Gurjaras.<sup>41</sup> We know from the Amarakośa<sup>42</sup>
<div n="lb"/>that ‘Ābhīrī’ was used to denote ‘Ābhīra woman or the wife of
<div n="lb"/>a cowherd’.
<div n="P"/>The Amarakośa<sup>43</sup> mentions Gopa, Gopāla, Gosaṃkhya,
<div n="lb"/>Godhuk and Ballava as the synonyms for Ābhīra and says that
<div n="lb"/>the village or place where Ābhīras lived is named as Ghoṣa or
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīrapallī.<sup>44</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Kashmirian recension of the Mahābhārata we get
<div n="lb"/>the readings ‘Kābhīra’ and ‘Kabhīra’ in place of Ābhīra.<sup>45</sup>
<div n="lb"/>These Kashmirian forms may have resulted from an attempt
<div n="lb"/>to record an initial glottal opening in the language of the
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīras. The Kasmiras probably knew the Ābhīras at an early
<div n="lb"/>date.<sup>46</sup>
<div n="P"/>Bhattacharya<sup>47</sup> describes the Ābhīrs or Ahīrs as a cowherd
<div n="lb"/>caste exceeding 8,000,000, and found almost everywhere in
<div n="lb"/>India north of the Narmadā. The Ābhīras are mentioned as
<div n="lb"/>foreigners in the Purāṇas.<sup>48</sup> Their kings were regarded as
<div n="lb"/>vrātya and mostly śūdras (black).<sup>49</sup> In the Mahābhārata the
<div n="lb"/>Ābhīras are called Mleccha.<sup>50</sup> According to Manu<sup>51</sup> they were
<div n="lb"/>the sons of a brāhmaṇa man and an ambaṣṭha woman, the
<div n="lb"/>Ambaṣṭhas being of mixed origin and known as the Ānava
<div n="lb"/>kṣatriyas.<sup>52</sup> The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>53</sup> places the Ābhīras in the
[Page-127+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Southern quarter of India.
<div n="P"/>Shafer<sup>54</sup> considers them to be an admixture possibly of
<div n="lb"/>white Iranian blood with enough Bhil blood to give them a
<div n="lb"/>a very dark colour and concludes that they were western
<div n="lb"/>Ānavas.<sup>55</sup>

2. {%Ārjunāyanas%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
<div n="lb"/>One of the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta.
<div n="P"/>The name Ārjuneya is mentioned in the Ṛgveda as the
<div n="lb"/>patronymic of Kautsa.<sup>56</sup> The tribe, associated with the name
<div n="lb"/>of Arjuna, existed in the Punjab and the North-West up to
<div n="lb"/>the advent of Gupta power in the fourth century A.D.<sup>57</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>word Arjuna in the Vedic literature<sup>58</sup> denotes ‘white’ and
<div n="lb"/>‘white lepresy’ and is also an epithet of Indra. But it does not
<div n="lb"/>denote a tribe or a human hero.
<div n="P"/>The word Arjuna has an unmistakable resemblance with
<div n="lb"/>the Śaka word erzuna, meaning a ‘leader’ or ‘chief’ which is
<div n="lb"/>derived from arzi. Analogous to it are the Śaka words {%aljsā,%}
<div n="lb"/>meaning ‘silvery’ and {%āljsata,%} meaning ‘silver’, that are akin to
<div n="lb"/>the Avestan word {%erezata%} (silver), the Sanskrit word {%rajata%}
<div n="lb"/>(silver) and the Persian word {%arziz%} (tin).<sup>59</sup> All these words have
<div n="lb"/>the original sense of whiteness and brightness, that are also
<div n="lb"/>connoted by the word arjuna in Sanskrit. It is highly significant
<div n="lb"/>that Arjuna, the hero of the Mahābhārata, is said to have borne
<div n="lb"/>this name, because he was ‘white’ and ‘pure’ in action.<sup>60</sup> All
<div n="lb"/>over the Eurasian steppes the nobles were regarded as ‘white’
<div n="lb"/>and the commoners were considered ‘black’. Hence the word
<div n="lb"/>for white colour was employed to denote the idea of leadership.
<div n="lb"/>This is why {%erzuna%} was used in the sense of a ‘leader’ in Śaka
<div n="lb"/>languages.<sup>61</sup>
<div n="P"/>Vedic and Śaka both branched from the same parent Indo-
<div n="lb"/>European language. Hence many words were common to both.
<div n="lb"/>But whereas arjuna in Vedic lost its pristine sense and was
<div n="lb"/>only used as an adjective, signifying ‘whiteness’, in Śaka it
<div n="lb"/>meant a ‘tribe’ and a human hero and later on this sense was
<div n="lb"/>imparted to this word in India as a result of the impact of the
<div n="lb"/>Śakas.<sup>62</sup>
<div n="P"/>The tribe, bearing the name of Arjuna, was also connected
<div n="lb"/>with some people of Chinese Turkestan, whose heroes, and
<div n="lb"/>kings had this designation.<sup>63</sup> In the Uighur redaction of the
[Page-128+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Hiḍimbāvadha<sup>64</sup> the name of Arjuna occurs in the form of
<div n="lb"/>Arcuni.<sup>65</sup> According to Sylvain Levi, this episode of the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata owed the privilege of entering into the Turkish world
<div n="lb"/>to the presence of the name of Arjuna in it, who was regarded
<div n="lb"/>as the eponymous founder of the dynasties of some Central
<div n="lb"/>Asiatic oases-states.<sup>66</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pāṇini<sup>67</sup> refers to the worshipper of Arjuna, called Arjunaka,
<div n="lb"/>together with the devotee of Vasudeva, called Vāsudevaka.
<div n="lb"/>This remark implies that Arjuna was treated as a deity at the
<div n="lb"/>time of Pāṇini and his followers occupied a prominent posi-
<div n="lb"/>tion. <sup>68</sup> The Kāśikā replaces Auddālakāyana of Patañjali by
<div n="lb"/>Ārjunāyana,<sup>69</sup> the name of a tribe nearer to its own time in
<div n="lb"/>discussing the meaning of Prācya-bhārata (II. 4. 66).
<div n="P"/>From the accounts relating to the invasion of India by
<div n="lb"/>Alexander we learn that a tribe named {%Agalassoi%} (Arjunāyana)
<div n="lb"/>fought with Alexander.<sup>70</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bṛhat-saṃhitā<sup>71</sup> places the Ārjunāyana in the northern
<div n="lb"/>division of India and describes them as being in the region of
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati.<sup>72</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ptolemy refers to a people in the Punjab whom he calls
<div n="lb"/>{%Pandoouoi%}<sup>73</sup> = Pāṇḍavas with whom the Ārjunāyanas may be
<div n="lb"/>connected.<sup>74</sup> Ārjunāyana coins are found in the Mathurā
<div n="lb"/>region and ‘they may be assigned with probability to the region
<div n="lb"/>lying west of Agra and Mathura, equivalent, roughly speaking,
<div n="lb"/>to the Bharatpur and Alwar States’.<sup>75</sup>

3. {%Āṭavika-rāja%}¦ (No. 1, L. 21):
<div n="lb"/>It is stated in the inscription that Samudragupta made all the
<div n="lb"/>kings of the forest countries his servants.<sup>76</sup> A mention
<div n="lb"/>of the forest kingdoms has also been made in Khoh Copper
<div n="lb"/>plate inscription of Saṃkshobha Gupta year 209.<sup>77</sup> These
<div n="lb"/>18 forest kingdoms were apparently in Central India
<div n="lb"/>including Ḍāhala or the Jabalpur region. <sup>78</sup> We find a refe-
<div n="lb"/>rence to the same in the Kanas plate of Lokavigraha.<sup>79</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The Vāyu and Matsya Purāṇas (XLV, 126 and CXIII, 48)
<div n="lb"/>read Āṭavyas which is no doubt the correct reading. Āṭavī as
<div n="lb"/>a city of the Deccan is mentioned in the Mahābhārata.<sup>80</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Āṭavyas were certainly the same as the Āṭavikas of the
<div n="lb"/>Allahabad Pillar Inscription and were perhaps aboriginal
<div n="lb"/>tribes dwelling in the jungle tracts of Central India.<sup>81</sup> We find
[Page-129+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>a reference to the Āṭavikas or the forest savages in the
<div n="lb"/>Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya and it was an Arthaśāstra practice
<div n="lb"/>to hire the Āṭavikas as scouts and army auxiliaries,<sup>82</sup> which
<div n="lb"/>needs must influence their future advance to civilization.
<div n="lb"/>Āṭavika-rāja should be translated as ‘forest-kings’ or ‘kings of
<div n="lb"/>forest countries’. We get a reference to Jāṅgalas in the Puranic
<div n="lb"/>List of Peoples.<sup>83</sup> Similar terms {%‘vana-rāṣṭra’%} ‘forest-countries’
<div n="lb"/>and {%vana-rājya%} ‘forest-kingdoms’ also occur in the Bṛhat-
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā.<sup>84</sup> But these countries lay in the north-east division
<div n="lb"/>of India, as mapped out by Varāhamihira, and they are, at
<div n="lb"/>any rate, not the countries referred here.<sup>85</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata, in one line of
<div n="lb"/>Sahadeva's {%digvijaya,%} Professor Franklin Edgerton changes
<div n="lb"/>{%Āṭavī%} to {%Antākhi,%} so that the line will refer to Antioch, Rome
<div n="lb"/>and the Greeks. Antioch, Rome and Greece were intimately
<div n="lb"/>associated in history and consequently they are still associated
<div n="lb"/>in the minds of Western scholars, and hence {%Antākhi%} made
<div n="lb"/>more sense to Edgerton in connection with Rome and the
<div n="lb"/>Greeks than {%Āṭavī.%} But it only represents his personal opi-
<div n="lb"/>nion.<sup>86</sup>

4. {%Daivaputra%}¦<sup>87</sup> (No. 1, L. 23):
<div n="lb"/>Daivaputras along with Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and
<div n="lb"/>Muruṇḍas are mentioned to have paid homage to Samudra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta by rendering to him all kinds of service.
<div n="P"/>The word ‘Daivaputra’ denotes those ‘who belong to
<div n="lb"/>{%devaputra%}’, i. e., Kaniṣka, i. e., the Kuṣāṇa ruler. The title
<div n="lb"/>devaputra has frequently been used as a title by the Kuṣāṇa
<div n="lb"/>kings.<sup>88</sup>
<div n="P"/>The common belief is that the designation {%devaputra%} ‘god-
<div n="lb"/>son’ was copied by the Kuṣāṇas from the ancient Chinese
<div n="lb"/>imperial title, ‘T’ien-tzu’, ‘son of heaven’.<sup>89</sup> Thomas considers
<div n="lb"/>that this title used by the Kuṣāṇas must have been borrowed
<div n="lb"/>from the Hsiung-nu (a Central Asian Tribe) and not directly
<div n="lb"/>from the Chinese.<sup>90</sup> Narain also believes the title to have been
<div n="lb"/>borrowed by the Kuṣāṇas from Central Asia.<sup>91</sup> The title has
<div n="lb"/>been frequently used by the kings in the Kharoṣṭhī documents
<div n="lb"/>discovered from Chinese Turkestan.<sup>92</sup> As regards the origin of
<div n="lb"/>the title, the divinity of the kings has been stressed upon in
<div n="lb"/>many ancient empires.<sup>93</sup> The ancient Indian concept for ‘Deva-
[Page-130+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>putra’<sup>94</sup> meaning ‘god-son’ is slightly different. It was not used
<div n="lb"/>for worldly kings but specifically for a class of distinguished
<div n="lb"/>divinites, which in Indian Buddhist texts was specifically used
<div n="lb"/>for four regional ‘great kings’, i. e., regents of four quarters,
<div n="lb"/>East, West, North and South who were ‘sons of heaven’. In
<div n="lb"/>the later Kuṣāṇa times, the term seems to have denoted the
<div n="lb"/>sense of Royal insignia.<sup>95</sup> In a Buddhist text of this period the
<div n="lb"/>question is raised ‘why kings are called {%devaputra%}’ and the
<div n="lb"/>answer is that before being born as a man, he was abiding
<div n="lb"/>among the gods (devas) and that, because the thirty-three gods
<div n="lb"/>(each) contributed to his substance, therefore, he is ‘god-son’.<sup>96</sup>
<div n="P"/>That Daivaputra denotes the Kuṣāṇas is obvious, since, no
<div n="lb"/>other Indian king is known to have been styled ‘devaputra’.
<div n="lb"/>Though Indian kings were usually addressed as ‘Deva’, we do
<div n="lb"/>not find any evidence of an Indian king referring to himself as
<div n="lb"/>{%deva.%} The Kuṣāṇas did not adopt {%devaputra%} as an official title
<div n="lb"/>in early times. It is totally absent from their coins, its reading
<div n="lb"/>on one coin of Kujula Kara Kaphsa being an error which
<div n="lb"/>has been noticed by Thomas after re-examining the coin in
<div n="lb"/>consultation with Allan.<sup>97</sup> Kaniṣka has not used the title even
<div n="lb"/>in Peshawar Casket Inscriptions which were officially engraved.
<div n="lb"/>It is only in documents inscribed by Indians that the title
<div n="lb"/>{%‘devaputra’%} is used for the Kuṣāṇa kings.<sup>98</sup> The title is used for
<div n="lb"/>the first time for Kaniṣka (known as Candana Kaniṣka).<sup>99</sup>
<div n="lb"/>{%Mahārāja -rājātirāja devaputra%} Kuṣāṇa of the Taxila Silver
<div n="lb"/>Scroll Inscription is generally taken to refer to Kaniṣka.<sup>100</sup>
<div n="lb"/>As rightly observed by Thomas “the devaputrasa of the scroll
<div n="lb"/>inscription is the first known instance of the application to
<div n="lb"/>the Kuṣāṇas of the designation devaputra, which regularly,
<div n="lb"/>though not invariably, recurs with Kaniṣka and his succes-
<div n="lb"/>sors.”<sup>101</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus we do not find the title Devaputra being used by
<div n="lb"/>the Kuṣāṇa rulers themselves but was applied to them by the
<div n="lb"/>Indians. Why of all ruling dynasties only the Kuṣāṇas were
<div n="lb"/>designated as ‘Devaputras’ is really inexplicable. Thomas
<div n="lb"/>suggests two possibilities. It may be due to the fact that the
<div n="lb"/>Indians saw some similarity between the figures of the grand
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣa and those of the burly Kusāṇa kings and the superior
<div n="lb"/>title of ‘Devaputra’ may have appeared to be a suitable appel-
[Page-131+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>lation. Another possibility is that they found some similarity
<div n="lb"/>between the Kuṣāṇa kings and Kubera (described in India as
<div n="lb"/>regent of the north and god of wealth and known as Devaputra
<div n="lb"/>in ancient Indian concept of Devaputra which simply means
<div n="lb"/>god-son), especially in view of the lavish gold coinage of the
<div n="lb"/>Kuṣāṇas. Aśvaghoṣa refers to the ‘great king Kanika’ as
<div n="lb"/>‘guardian of the northern heaven’.<sup>102</sup> It is also likely that
<div n="lb"/>the title devaputra may have been given due to Śiva-maheśvara,
<div n="lb"/>whom we have seen styled as Devaputra and who is the sole
<div n="lb"/>deity figured on the coins of Wima Kadphises.<sup>103</sup> These facts
<div n="lb"/>need further investigation.
<div n="P"/>Most probably from the Epic Period, Indian concept of
<div n="lb"/>Devaputra ‘god-son’ is linked with kings to give them divinity
<div n="lb"/>and not as a title.<sup>104</sup> Aśoka could claim the title only of
<div n="lb"/>{%‘Devānām priya’%}<sup>105</sup> meaning ‘the beloved of the gods’. Thus
<div n="lb"/>{%Devaputra%} or ‘god-son’ was a superior title given to the Kuṣāṇas
<div n="lb"/>by Indians. It is interesting to note that the epithet {%Devaputravat%}
<div n="lb"/>has been used for Buddha in one of our inscriptions<sup>106</sup>

<div n="lb"/>stated to have inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Hūṇas: “By
<div n="lb"/>whose (Skandagupta's) two arms the earth was shaken, when
<div n="lb"/>he, the creator (of a disturbance like that) of a terrible whirl-
<div n="lb"/>pool, joined in close conflict with the Hūṇas...”.<sup>107</sup> The defeat
<div n="lb"/>inflated upon the Hūṇas proved so decisive that for nearly
<div n="lb"/>half a century the Gupta empire was immune from their
<div n="lb"/>depredations.<sup>108</sup>
<div n="P"/>Hūṇas, also known as Ephthalites or Hiung-nu were a
<div n="lb"/>Central Asian tribe.
<div n="P"/>Uigur<sup>109</sup> transcribes the name of the tribe in ancient
<div n="lb"/>Chinese in two phonetic forms: one of which is ‘xūnu or xunu’,
<div n="lb"/>the other {%‘xunux, xunuo, xunu’.%} The first part ({%xun%} — ) of the last
<div n="lb"/>form is not in doubt and neither is the {%u%} of the last part, the
<div n="lb"/>only question is about the change of the initial {%i%} of ancient
<div n="lb"/>Chinese into {%y%} in Uigur before {%u%} and in Sandhi, and about
<div n="lb"/>the pronunciation of the final consonant.<sup>110</sup>
<div n="P"/>The first of the above Chinese forms which comes as close
<div n="lb"/>to the {%Hunu%} as to the Sanskrit {%Hūṇa%} is very similar to the
[Page-132+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Chinese “transcription” {%Xunu%} or {%Xūnu,%} and Avesta {%Hunu,%}
<div n="lb"/>except the Sanskrit has substituted for the final root vowel {%‘u’%}
<div n="lb"/>the stem final — a characteristic of the names of peoples in that
<div n="lb"/>language. “The Purāṇas have a form {%Urṇa%} which together with
<div n="lb"/>Epic Skr. {%Hūṇa%} suggests Indic Hūrṇa Turk, {%Xūrnu%}”.<sup>111</sup>
<div n="P"/>We may note here the Tibetan {%Hor,%} which corresponds
<div n="lb"/>with the first syllable of the reconstructed form {%Hūr-ṇa.%} The
<div n="lb"/>difference of vowels may indicate a back dipthong or back
<div n="lb"/>vowel between {%o%} and {%u,%} as Ptolemy's Xoūnoi suggests, since
<div n="lb"/>the Greeks wrote {%u (y)%} for Indic {%u.%}<sup>112</sup>
<div n="P"/>Though all the above forms go back to one primitive form,
<div n="lb"/>we cannot say the same for the people to whom they were
<div n="lb"/>applied. The general opinion is that the Hsiung-nus, Huns,
<div n="lb"/>Hūṇas etc., were Turks. Some scholars consider them to have
<div n="lb"/>been a mixture of many tribes, Iranians, Mongols, and Paleosi-
<div n="lb"/>birians (ancestors of the Yenissei-ostyaks). Whatever may have
<div n="lb"/>been the dominant race or speech was, it can be seen that
<div n="lb"/>there must have been several subject people and subject armies
<div n="lb"/>in such far-flung empires, necessitating some mixture and
<div n="lb"/>mutual influence — ethnic, linguistic and cultural.<sup>113</sup> Otto
<div n="lb"/>Maenchen-Helfen has discussed the whole question on the
<div n="lb"/>basis of the evidence of language, history, ethnology,
<div n="lb"/>and archaeology<sup>114</sup> and has pointed out that the greater part
<div n="lb"/>of the Hsiung-nu vocabulary pointed to Mongol<sup>115</sup> Later
<div n="lb"/>Pelliot considered the same vocabulary and established that the
<div n="lb"/>{%Hsiung%}-nu and {%Huns%} were Turks.<sup>116</sup>
<div n="P"/>Louis Bazin<sup>117</sup> and Von Gabain<sup>118</sup> also reached the conclu-
<div n="lb"/>sion that in language of the {%Hsiung-nu%} there was a high percent-
<div n="lb"/>age of Turkish words.<sup>119</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the second century B.C. the {%Hiung-nu (Huns)%} started a
<div n="lb"/>movement near the Chinese frontier and succeeded in destroying
<div n="lb"/>the Greco-Bactrian empire, in strongly menacing the existence
<div n="lb"/>of the house of Arsakes, and in landing crowds of Central
<div n="lb"/>Asian invaders within the borders of India. In the latter half
<div n="lb"/>of the fourth century A.D., a brach of them, the White Huns,
<div n="lb"/>or Ephthalites, flooded the South of Asia; and ‘about the time
<div n="lb"/>when the last legions of Rome shattered on the plains of
<div n="lb"/>Chalons, the motley hordes of Attila, the White Huns had
<div n="lb"/>begun to tread Sassanian Persia under the hoofs of their
[Page-133+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>horses, and were soon to smash the Indian empire of the
<div n="lb"/>Guptas into pieces’.<sup>120</sup>
<div n="P"/>In A.D. 484 the Hūṇas killed the Sassanian ruler of Persia.
<div n="lb"/>Towards the close of the fifth century A.D. they ruled over a
<div n="lb"/>vast empire with their principal capital at Balkh.<sup>121</sup> We know
<div n="lb"/>of a {%Hūṇa-deśa%} placed to the South of the Kāma-giri and to
<div n="lb"/>the North of Maru-deśa, i. e., the desert called the land of
<div n="lb"/>heroes. The Harṣacarita places the Hūṇa country in the Punjab
<div n="lb"/>region practically suggesting the same area.<sup>122</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the middle of the sixth century A.D., the Sassanian king
<div n="lb"/>of Persia made an alliance with Western Turks against the
<div n="lb"/>Hūṇas and smashed their rule from the Oxus by killing their
<div n="lb"/>king sometime between A.D. 563 and 567.<sup>123</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know of Toramāṇa from his Eraṇ Boar Inscription<sup>124</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and of Mihirakula from his Gwalior Inscription.<sup>125</sup> These
<div n="lb"/>two are generally taken to have been Hūṇa chiefs. There is
<div n="lb"/>another inscription found at Kura (Salt range in the Punjab)
<div n="lb"/>refering to {%Rājādhirāja Mahārāja%} Toramāṇa-Ṣāhi-Jau (bla),
<div n="lb"/>whom some scholars identify with king Toramāṇa mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in the Eraṇ Inscription,<sup>126</sup> but others regard the two as quite
<div n="lb"/>different.<sup>127</sup> Here it must be pointed out, none of these inscrip-
<div n="lb"/>tions describes any of these kings as Hūṇas nor contains any
<div n="lb"/>reference to the Hūṇas.
<div n="P"/>We find an interesting account of Toramāṇa in the Jain
<div n="lb"/>work, Kuvalayamālā, composed to 700 Śaka (A.D. 778).<sup>128</sup> Here
<div n="lb"/>Toramāṇa is stated to have lived on the bank of the Candrab-
<div n="lb"/>hāgā (Chenab river). His guru Hari-gupta, who himself was a
<div n="lb"/>scion of the Gupta family, also lived there.<sup>129</sup>
<div n="P"/>Both Toramāṇa and Mihirakula are referred to in the Rāja-
<div n="lb"/>taraṅgiṇī, but there is no mention of their being the Hūṇas.
<div n="P"/>It is doubtful whether Toramāṇa and Mihirakula were Hūṇas
<div n="lb"/>or Kuṣāṇas. Sir Aurel Stein, Jayaswal<sup>130</sup> and Fleet<sup>131</sup> held that
<div n="lb"/>Toramāṇa was a Kuṣāṇa. But Sten Konow<sup>132</sup> holds that Tora-
<div n="lb"/>māṇa was, in all probability, a Hūṇa, as is generally assumed,
<div n="lb"/>and not a Kuṣāṇa. It is not unlikely that the Hūṇas and the
<div n="lb"/>Kuṣāṇas were ethnically allied and were later merged into a
<div n="lb"/>new nation, which came to be known as Hūṇa in India.<sup>133</sup>
<div n="P"/>There are several stray references to the Hūṇas in Indian
<div n="lb"/>literature. D.C. Sircar<sup>134</sup> opines that the Indian names {%Hūṇa,%}
[Page-134+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>{%Hārahūṇa%} or {%Hārahūra,%} supposed to be associated with the
<div n="lb"/>Chinese name {%Hiung-nu%} and ‘the White Hun’ of the European
<div n="lb"/>writers, are mentioned in a few late passages of the Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>and in the geographical sections of the early Purāṇas, can be
<div n="lb"/>roughly assigned to the 4th century A.D. A sūtra-vṛtti in the
<div n="lb"/>Candra Vyākaraṇa has the sentence ‘{%ajayad-gupta%} (or Japto or
<div n="lb"/>Jarto) {%Hūṇān%}’ as an illustration of the use of the imperfect to
<div n="lb"/>express an event which occurred within the life-time of the
<div n="lb"/>author.<sup>135</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Mandasor inscription of Yaśodharman<sup>136</sup> a reference
<div n="lb"/>is made to the chiefs of the Hūṇas, but they are not named.
<div n="lb"/>The inscription simply says that Yaśodharman possessed coun-
<div n="lb"/>tries which not even the Guptas and the chiefs of the Hūṇas
<div n="lb"/>could subdue.<sup>137</sup>
<div n="P"/>The inscription also refers to Mihirakula “who had earlier
<div n="lb"/>bowed only to the god Sthāṇu (Śiva) and whose forehead was
<div n="lb"/>pained through being bent low down by the strength of the arm
<div n="lb"/>of Yaśodharman in the act of compelling obeisance”.<sup>138</sup>
<div n="P"/>With the fall of Yaśodharman, which probably took place
<div n="lb"/>not long after, Mihirakula again came to the forefront. In the
<div n="lb"/>early part of the sixth century A.D. Śākala become his capital.<sup>139</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The Gupta king who then occupied the imperial throne was
<div n="lb"/>probably Narasiṃha-Gupta Bālāditya. He was temporarily over-
<div n="lb"/>whelmed by the victorious raids of Yaśodharman, and Mihirak-
<div n="lb"/>ula evidently took advantage of this imperial crisis to extend
<div n="lb"/>his power. Narasiṃhagupta, according to Hiuen Tsang, was
<div n="lb"/>forced to the humiliating position of paying tribute to Mihira-
<div n="lb"/>kula but finally triumphed over his rival.<sup>140</sup>
<div n="P"/>The defeat of Mihirakula appears to have finally crushed
<div n="lb"/>the political supremacy of the Hūṇas in India who ceased to
<div n="lb"/>be even a disturbing element in Indian History.<sup>141</sup> The Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>place the Hūṇas in the extreme west, with the Sauvīras,
<div n="lb"/>Saindhavas, Śākalas and Madras.<sup>142</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Raghuvaṃśa, Kālidāsa mentions Raghu defeating
<div n="lb"/>the Hūṇas on the banks of the Vaṅkṣu or the Oxus<sup>143</sup>, the (pale)
<div n="lb"/>faces of whose wives spoke of the bravery of their husbands
<div n="lb"/>(who died in the battle).<sup>144</sup>
<div n="P"/>Varāhamihira<sup>145</sup> mentions them under the jurisdiction of
<div n="lb"/>Ketu and places them in the North.<sup>146</sup> Dr. Upendra Thakur<sup>147</sup>
[Page-135+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>remarks that about the sixth century A.D., the Hūṇas almost
<div n="lb"/>lost their original name of {%Hiong-nou%} or {%Huns.%} Later the powerful
<div n="lb"/>Turks give its name to the entire Hūṇa nation by which they
<div n="lb"/>were further known in the neighbouring nations. Afterwards
<div n="lb"/>they were submerged in the Mongols under the influence of the
<div n="lb"/>powerful Mongol Chief Chengiz Khan. Thus, the {%Hiong-nou%} or
<div n="lb"/>{%Huns%} received different names in different periods beginning
<div n="lb"/>with their origin to their advancement in other countries. In
<div n="lb"/>spite of the copious references to the Ephthalites in the accounts
<div n="lb"/>of the different countries, it is very difficult to determine their
<div n="lb"/>exact origin and ethnic affinities.
<div n="P"/>We can partly agree with Dr. Thakur as regards their
<div n="lb"/>merger in the area later dominated by the Turks and Mongols
<div n="lb"/>but the Hūṇas find their mention in the Harṣa-Carita of Bāṇa
<div n="lb"/>(a seventh century work) and they remained a potent force in
<div n="lb"/>the social and political life of the Punjab-Rajasthan-Malwa-
<div n="lb"/>Gujarat region during the early medieval period as evidenced
<div n="lb"/>by a large number of epigraphical and literary records, and
<div n="lb"/>also proved themselves as a source of danger to the Pāla kings
<div n="lb"/>of Bengal<sup>148</sup>

<div n="lb"/>mentioned in the Batihagadh Inscription<sup>155</sup> of the Damoh
<div n="lb"/>district of M.P. Kharpara<sup>156</sup> means a thief, a rogue or a cheat.
<div n="lb"/>The name Kharaparika does not occur elsewhere in inscrip-

<div n="lb"/>a tribe called Khara-sāgara-rāśīs,<sup>158</sup> along with the Gand-
<div n="lb"/>haras and the Yaudheyas; and the Matsya Purāṇa<sup>159</sup> refers

<div n="lb"/>It is difficult to say whether Khara-sāgara-rāśī and Kharapatha

8. {%Kotas%}¦ (No. 1, L. 14):
<div n="lb"/>The Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta mentions
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta's capturing a king born in the family of the
<div n="lb"/>Kotas.<sup>162</sup> Mookerji equates the Kota-kulaja of the inscription
<div n="lb"/>with king Kalyāṇavarman of the play ‘Kaumudī-Mahotsava’.<sup>163</sup>
<div n="lb"/>But it is now generally believed<sup>164</sup> that ‘the episode of the
<div n="lb"/>Kaumudī-Mahotsava has no bearing whatsoever on the early
<div n="lb"/>Gupta History’.
<div n="P"/>The coins of the Kotas bearing their name have been found
<div n="lb"/>in East Punjab, and Delhi, and ‘they probably ruled in the
<div n="lb"/>Upper Gangetic valley’.<sup>165</sup> Scholars differ in their views
<div n="lb"/>about placing the Kotas; some identify it with Kanyakubja
<div n="lb"/>while others with Pāṭaliputra.<sup>166</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is known that Puṣpapura or Kusumapura was the name of
<div n="lb"/>both the Pāṭaliputra and Kānyakubja.<sup>167</sup> It must, however, be
<div n="lb"/>noted that the city of Puṣpa here is connected mainly with
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta and not with the Kota-kulaja,<sup>168</sup> so the location
<div n="lb"/>of the city of the Kotas is not to be traced in Kusumapura or
<div n="lb"/>Puṣpapura. It is well known that Candragupta I received
<div n="lb"/>Magadha through his Licchavi-alliance and it is possible that
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta enjoyed his youth playfully at Pāṭaliputra
<div n="lb"/>({%Puṣpa-āhvaye krīḍatā%}). So Goyal's assumption that ‘Hariṣeṇa
<div n="lb"/>has referred to Kānyakubja and not Pāṭaliputra’<sup>169</sup> is incorrect.
<div n="lb"/>It is only later that Kānyakubja gains the honour of being
<div n="lb"/>called Kusumapura when the glory of Pāṭaliputra had started
<div n="lb"/>declining.<sup>170</sup>
<div n="P"/>In view of the context of the victory over Kota-kulaja
<div n="lb"/>along with the Nāga kings Acyuta and Nāgasena and with the
<div n="lb"/>support of numismatic evidence it may be said that the kotas
<div n="lb"/>lived somewhere between East Punjab and Delhi.

<L>322<pc>136<k1>kurus<k2>kurus
9. {%Kurus%}¦ (No. 22, L. 7):
<div n="lb"/>The Kurus were divided into two branches, the Northern and
<div n="lb"/>the Southern.<sup>171</sup> We have here a reference to the Uttarakurus.<sup>172</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kurus were one of the most ancient and prominent of
<div n="lb"/>the Indo-Āryan kṣatriya tribes.<sup>173</sup> In the earliest literature the
<div n="lb"/>Kurus do not appear under that name as a people. But
[Page-137+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>mention is made of a prince, Kuruśravaṇa (Glory of the
<div n="lb"/>Kurus)<sup>174</sup> and of a Pākasthāman Kauravyāyaṇa.<sup>175</sup> The Athar-
<div n="lb"/>vaveda<sup>176</sup> refers to Parīkṣita as a king of the Kurus and his
<div n="lb"/>son, Janamejaya, is mentioned in the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>177</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as one of the great performers of the horse sacrifice.
<div n="P"/>Oldenberg<sup>178</sup> seems to be right in suggesting that the
<div n="lb"/>Kuru people, as known later, included some of the tribes
<div n="lb"/>referred to by other names in the Ṛgveda. Kuruśravaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>shown by his name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛgveda called Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’
<div n="lb"/>who is well known as a king of the Purus. Moreover, it is
<div n="lb"/>likely that the Tṛtsu-Bharatas, who appear in the Ṛgveda as
<div n="lb"/>enemies of the Purus, later coalesced with them to form the
<div n="lb"/>Kuru people.<sup>179</sup> Moreover, there is evidence that the Bharatas
<div n="lb"/>occupied the territory in which the Kurus were later found.
<div n="lb"/>Two of them are spoken of in a hymn of the Ṛgveda<sup>180</sup> as
<div n="lb"/>having kindled fire on the Dṛṣadvatī, the Āpayā, and the
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī — that is to say, in the sacred places of the later
<div n="lb"/>Kurukshetra.<sup>181</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Brāhmaṇa literature, the Kurus are often con-
<div n="lb"/>nected with Pāñcālas.<sup>182</sup>
<div n="P"/>The territory of the Kuru-Pāñcālas is declared in the
<div n="lb"/>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa to be the middle country (Madhyadeśa).<sup>183</sup>
<div n="lb"/>A group of the Kuru people still remained further north — the
<div n="lb"/>Uttara Kurus beyond the Himalayas.<sup>184</sup> It appears from a
<div n="lb"/>passage of the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa that the speech of the
<div n="lb"/>Northerners-that is, presumably the Northern Kurus-and of the
<div n="lb"/>Kuru — Pāñcālas was similar, and regarded as specially pure.<sup>185</sup>
<div n="lb"/>There seems little doubt that the Brahmanical Culture was
<div n="lb"/>developed in the country of the Kuru-Pāñcālas, and that it
<div n="lb"/>spread thence east, south and west. <sup>186</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Uttara Kurus, who play a mythical part in the Epic
<div n="lb"/>and later literature, are still a historical people in the Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa.<sup>187</sup> where they are located beyond the Himalayas
<div n="lb"/>(pareṇa Himavantam). In another passege,<sup>188</sup> however, the
<div n="lb"/>country of the Uttara Kurus is stated by Vasiṣṭha Sāthavya
<div n="lb"/>to be a land of the gods ({%deva-kṣetra%}), but Jānṃtapi
<div n="lb"/>Atyarāti was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not wholly
<div n="lb"/>mythical. It is reasonable to accept Zimmer's view that the
[Page-138+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>northern Kurus were settled in Kashmir, especially as Kuruk-
<div n="lb"/>shetra is the region where tribes advancing from Kashmir
<div n="lb"/>might naturally be found.<sup>189</sup> In Buddhist literature, Uttara-
<div n="lb"/>Kuru is very often mentioned as a mythic region, but there are
<div n="lb"/>some passages which go to show that there was a faint memory
<div n="lb"/>of a country that once had a historical existence.<sup>190</sup>
<div n="P"/>Some time before the fourth century B.C., the monarchical
<div n="lb"/>constitution of the Kurus gave place to a republic, for we are
<div n="lb"/>told by Kauṭilya<sup>191</sup> that the Kurus were {%‘rāja-śabdopajīvinaḥ’,%}
<div n="lb"/>or ‘enjoying the status of rājan’ — i. e. all citizens had equal rank
<div n="lb"/>and rights.<sup>192</sup>
<div n="P"/>Shafer<sup>193</sup> shows that only the upper castes of the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>were Āryan, the bulk of the population were probably non-
<div n="lb"/>Āryan as is clear from the fact that whereas the Kauravas
<div n="lb"/>rallied the support mostly of the non-Āryans, the Pāṇḍavas
<div n="lb"/>had the support of Āryans and concludes that the Northern
<div n="lb"/>Kurus were Muṇḍic.<sup>194</sup>

<div n="lb"/>The epithet ‘Licchavi-dauhitra’ (daughter's son of the Licchavi)
<div n="lb"/>for Samudragupta occurs in all these Gupta records It
<div n="lb"/>suggests the importance of Candragupta I's marriage with the
<div n="lb"/>Licchavi princess Kumāradevī. The alliance had no social
<div n="lb"/>importance but it was important for political gain by virtue
<div n="lb"/>of which Candragupta I (Samudragupta's father) gained power-
<div n="lb"/>ful position in Magadha and the neighbouring countries. In
<div n="lb"/>the Candragupta-Kumāradevī-coins, we have no mention of
<div n="lb"/>the Guptas but only of the Licchavis in plural {%‘Licchavayaḥ’%}
<div n="lb"/>(the Licchavis). This supports the amalgamation of the
<div n="lb"/>Guptas with the Licchavis and we may agree with Majumdar
<div n="lb"/>that ‘the epithet {%Licchavi dauhitra%} was deliberately given to
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta to emphasize his right of succession to the dual
<div n="lb"/>monarchy’.<sup>195</sup>
<div n="P"/>We also know of a house of the Licchavis at Nepal<sup>196</sup> but
<div n="lb"/>the separate reference to Nepal as a tributary province in the
<div n="lb"/>Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta<sup>197</sup> proves that it
<div n="lb"/>was different from the Licchavi kingdom which Samudragupta
<div n="lb"/>had inherited from his mother. The Licchavi kingdom of
[Page-139+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Kumāradevī may be located in North Bihar with Vaiśālī
<div n="lb"/>(modern Basarh in Muzaffarpur district) as its centre.<sup>198</sup> It was
<div n="lb"/>a credit for the astute diplomacy of Candragupta to marry the
<div n="lb"/>Licchavi princess as we know, in ancient times, the Licchavis of
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśālī had been the rivals of the kings of Pāṭaliputra<sup>199</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>that they did not marry outside their area.<sup>200</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name of this powerful people has come to us in many
<div n="lb"/>different readings:
<div n="P"/>Licchavi, Lecchavi, Lecchai, Lecchaki, Licchvi, Nicchivi,
<div n="P"/>Lichikki and Lichavi.
<div n="P"/>Of these the Licchavi has been most commonly used in
<div n="lb"/>literature.<sup>201</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of this people is in Kauṭilya's Artha-
<div n="lb"/>śāstra,<sup>202</sup> where they are called Licchavis. Here we read that
<div n="lb"/>the corporations of Licchivi, Vṛji, Malla, Madra, Kakura,
<div n="lb"/>Kuru, Pañcāla and others were {%‘rājaśabdopajīvinaḥ’.%} It is note-
<div n="lb"/>worthy that Kauṭilya distinguishes the Licchavis from the Vṛjis
<div n="lb"/>though some scholars consider them to be one.<sup>203</sup> H. Pandey<sup>204</sup>
<div n="lb"/>says that it appears from the Pali suttas that the names Vajji
<div n="lb"/>and Licchavi are interchangeable to some extent. But the
<div n="lb"/>accounts of Chinese pilgrims point to a different conclusion.
<div n="lb"/>Fa-Hien describes the kingdom of Vaiśālī where ‘Licchavis’
<div n="lb"/>were the people of the country. He does not mention Vṛji or
<div n="lb"/>Vajji. Hiuen Tsang describes Vaiśālī and Vṛji as two distinct
<div n="lb"/>countries, and Watters is inclined to doubt the accuracy of his
<div n="lb"/>description of the Vṛji country.<sup>205</sup> But we know that Vajji was
<div n="lb"/>a powerful confederacy of which the Videhas along with the
<div n="lb"/>Licchavis, Jñātrikas, Ugras, Bhojas and others were the cons-
<div n="lb"/>tituent confederate clans (aṭṭhakula). Of these the Licchavis and
<div n="lb"/>the Videhas were the most important, and the Licchavi Capital
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśālī was the head-quarter of the confederacy.<sup>206</sup> But Ray
<div n="lb"/>Chaudhuri observes: “Vajji was not only the name of the
<div n="lb"/>confederacy but also of one of the constituent clans. But the
<div n="lb"/>Vajjis like the Licchavis are sometimes associated with the
<div n="lb"/>city of Vaiśālī which was not only the capital of the Licchavi
<div n="lb"/>clan, but also the metropolis of the entire confederacy”.<sup>207</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Licchavi republic was generally called the saṃgha or gaṇa of
<div n="lb"/>the Vajjis. The Licchavis would not possibly have allowed this
<div n="lb"/>name, had they not themselves been Vajjians. In one passage,
[Page-140+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>the Licchavi Mahānāma, seeing that a band of young Licchavis
<div n="lb"/>who had been out hunting were gathered round the Buddha, is
<div n="lb"/>represented as saying, “They (i. e. the Licchavis) will become
<div n="lb"/>Vajjians, they will become Vajjians ({%bhavissanti Vajji bhavis-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%santi Vajji)%}”! This possibly only means that there was great
<div n="lb"/>hope of these Licchavi young men becoming true Vajjians,
<div n="lb"/>practising the seven conditions of welfare taught by the
<div n="lb"/>Buddha, conditions which endured their prosperity, and lead-
<div n="lb"/>ing a more cultured life. Thus the Vajji appears to be a more
<div n="lb"/>dignified term. It might have originally been given to the tribe
<div n="lb"/>which inhabited what is known as {%Vajjiraṭṭha (Vṛji-rāṣṭra),%} i. e.,
<div n="lb"/>the Vajjian country, in Buddhist literature. Later a separation
<div n="lb"/>seems to have taken place among the Vajjis and Licchavis,
<div n="lb"/>because the Arthaśāstra (XI. I) mentions the Licchavika and
<div n="lb"/>the Vṛjika as two distinct republics.<sup>208</sup>
<div n="P"/>The clan of the Licchavis figures very prominently in the
<div n="lb"/>annals of early Buddhism. Buddhaghoṣa, the celebrated Pali
<div n="lb"/>commentator has the following story<sup>209</sup>: The chief queen of
<div n="lb"/>the king of Benaras, at the time of her child-birth delivered
<div n="lb"/>lump of flesh, ‘of the colour of lac and of bandhu and Jīvaka
<div n="lb"/>flowers’. Fearing the displeasure of the king if he should hear
<div n="lb"/>of this, the other queens put the lump of flesh into a casket
<div n="lb"/>marked with royal seal and placed it on the flowing waters of
<div n="lb"/>the Ganges. The casket was discovered by an ascetic, and
<div n="lb"/>taken by him to his hermitage, where he cared for the lump of
<div n="lb"/>flesh. After the lapse of some time, tha lump broke up into
<div n="lb"/>two pieces of flesh, which gradually assumed shape, till finally
<div n="lb"/>one of them became a boy resplendent like gold, and the other a
<div n="lb"/>girl. Whatever entered the stomach of these two infants looked
<div n="lb"/>as if put into a vessel of precious transparent stone {%(maṇi)%}
<div n="lb"/>so that they seemed to have no skin {%(Nicchavi).%} Others said: ‘the
<div n="lb"/>two were attached to each other by their skin {%(līna-chavi)%} as if
<div n="lb"/>they had been sewn together’; so that these infants came to be
<div n="lb"/>designated ‘Licchavis’. We are further told that on coming of
<div n="lb"/>age the boy and the girl were married to each other and from
<div n="lb"/>this brother and sister union sprang the race of the Licchavis<sup>210</sup>
<div n="P"/>The origin of the Licchavis has been a matter of great
<div n="lb"/>controversy. They have been represented as Scythians, Kolari-
<div n="lb"/>ans, Tibetans and Persians by different authorities.<sup>211</sup>
[Page-141+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Samuel Beal<sup>212</sup> takes the Licchavis or Vajjis to be a
<div n="lb"/>branch of the ‘Yue-Chi’ forgetting that the latter came to India
<div n="lb"/>in the first century B.C. while the Licchavis were a highly
<div n="lb"/>civilized and prosperous people in the sixth century B.C.
<div n="P"/>In the opinion of J.P. Hewitt, there are “very strong
<div n="lb"/>indications that the Vajjians, who were certainly the earliest
<div n="lb"/>settlers in the country, were of Kolarian race who had lived
<div n="lb"/>there long before the arrival of the Dravidians and Āryans”.
<div n="lb"/>The learned writer ignores the existence of the pre-Vajjian
<div n="lb"/>Āryan dynasty of rulers at Vaiśālī.<sup>213</sup>
<div n="P"/>V.A. Smith<sup>214</sup> found similarities between the customs of
<div n="lb"/>the Tibetans and those of the Licchavis in the practice of the
<div n="lb"/>exposure of the dead and also in judicial procedure. And
<div n="lb"/>hence he came to the conclusion that the Licchavis, the
<div n="lb"/>ruling tribe or clan in Vṛji country of which Vaiśālī was the
<div n="lb"/>capital, was reallya Tibetan (or Mongolian) tribe which settled
<div n="lb"/>in the plains during the prehistoric times. The view has been
<div n="lb"/>criticised by B.C. Law, K.P. Jayaswal, H.C. Raychaudhuri
<div n="lb"/>and others on the following grounds<sup>215</sup>:
<div n="HI"/>(1) The custom of the disposal of the dead was prevalent
<div n="lb"/>among the Vedic Āryans from whom the Licchavis
<div n="lb"/>were descended;
<div n="HI"/>(2) In the case of Tibet we have only three courts as
<div n="lb"/>against the seven tribunals of the Licchavis; further
<div n="lb"/>we know very little about the relative antiquity of the
<div n="lb"/>Tibetan procedure which might very well have been
<div n="lb"/>suggested by the system expounded in the Aṭṭhakathā.
<div n="P"/>S.C. Vidyābhūṣaṇa<sup>216</sup> suggests a Persian origin for the
<div n="lb"/>Licchavis holding that the name Licchavi ({%Nicchavi%} of Manu,
<div n="lb"/>X. 22) was derived from the Persian city of {%Nisibis.%} There
<div n="lb"/>is very little in Vidyābhūṣaṇa's surmise except a fancied
<div n="lb"/>resemblance between the names Nicchivi and Nisibis. Inscrip-
<div n="lb"/>tions of the Achaemenids are silent about any Persian settle-
<div n="lb"/>ment in the Eastern India in the sixth or fifth century B.C. The
<div n="lb"/>Licchavi people were more interested in {%Yakṣa caityas%} and the
<div n="lb"/>teaching of Mahāvīra and the Buddha than in the deities and
<div n="lb"/>Prophets of Iran.<sup>217</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Licchavis have been invariably represented as kṣatriyas
<div n="lb"/>in ancient Indian literature. As the Mahāparinibbāṇa-Sutta
[Page-142+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>informs us, they claimed a share of the remnants of the
<div n="lb"/>Buddha's body on the ground that they were kṣatriyas like the
<div n="lb"/>Buddha himself: “The Exalted one was a kṣatriya and so are
<div n="lb"/>we. We are worthy to receive a portion of relies of the Exalted
<div n="lb"/>one”. We get many other similar instances.<sup>218</sup> We find that
<div n="lb"/>both the Śākyas (to whose race the Buddha belonged) and the
<div n="lb"/>Licchavis are described as progenies of brother and sister
<div n="lb"/>unions. Like the Śākyas, the Licchavis are also described as
<div n="lb"/>kṣatriyas.<sup>219</sup> Manu speaks of the Licchavis as kṣatriyas, though
<div n="lb"/>of the Vrātya variety.<sup>220</sup> Regarding the Vrātyas, Manu says:
<div n="lb"/>‘Those (sons) whom the twice-born have by the wives of equal
<div n="lb"/>caste, but who, not fulfilling their scared duties, are excluded
<div n="lb"/>from the initiation to {%Sāvitrī,%} one must designate by the appel-
<div n="lb"/>lation vrātyas’.<sup>221</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know that Mahāvīra, the founder of Jainism, was the
<div n="lb"/>very kin of the Licchavis and that he had many followers
<div n="lb"/>among the residents of Vaiśālī, even among the highest officers.
<div n="lb"/>Then again, between the sixth century B.C. and 200 B.C., the
<div n="lb"/>earliest estimated date of the Manusmṛti,<sup>222</sup> the Licchavis had
<div n="lb"/>won the good graces of the Buddha as well as of the followers
<div n="lb"/>of the religion he preached. During this long interval, when the
<div n="lb"/>two great ‘heretic’ faiths flourished in their country, the
<div n="lb"/>Licchavis might not have been particular to the ceremonies and
<div n="lb"/>practices that the regulations of the orthodox brāhmaṇas
<div n="lb"/>required. ‘Hence we can understand how Manu, the great
<div n="lb"/>brāhmaṇa law-giver came to refer to the Licchavis as
<div n="lb"/>Vrātyas’.<sup>223</sup> But Gokhale<sup>224</sup> takes the term kṣatriya in this
<div n="lb"/>context to mean representative of political power rather than
<div n="lb"/>a specific caste in the brahminical hierarchy and from the word
<div n="lb"/>{%Vrātya%} infers that they were outside the pale of the brahminical
<div n="lb"/>civilization.
<div n="P"/>Scholars have divergent views about the connotation of the
<div n="lb"/>word ‘Vrātya’.<sup>225</sup> Charpentier described the Vrātyas, as a band
<div n="lb"/>of people not governed by the rules of caste, probably repre-
<div n="lb"/>senting the worst elements of Indian society, — the thief, the
<div n="lb"/>robber, the drunken one, etc. But Keith rejected this view by
<div n="lb"/>pointing out that Manu's reference to the {%Rājanya Vrātyas,%}
<div n="lb"/>e. g. Licchavis and Mallas (X. 22) has no value for Vedic
<div n="lb"/>times.<sup>226</sup> Haver in his article ‘Der Vrātya’ derives ‘Vrātya’
[Page-143+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>from {%‘vrata’.%} Thus the oldest meaning of ‘Vrāta’ is a group of
<div n="lb"/>people bound by holy ceremonies, bound by a vow to cult-
<div n="lb"/>actions being derived from {%‘vrata’%} which is a vow taken in the
<div n="lb"/>service of a god. The {%Vrātīnas,%} on the other hand, ‘were
<div n="lb"/>Aryans of a more primitive culture and religion, than the
<div n="lb"/>orthodox brāhmaṇas, and were organised in cult-unions and
<div n="lb"/>both {%‘vrātya’%} and {%‘vrātīna’%} being derived from {%‘vrata’%} are
<div n="lb"/>‘members of the same holy union’. The only difference between
<div n="lb"/>them apparently was that the Vrātīna went to the brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>countries to perform the Vrātya-work and were paid for it,
<div n="lb"/>while the Vrātyas acted in their own homeland.<sup>227</sup>
<div n="P"/>From all these considerations, we can see that the views of
<div n="lb"/>Manu and the suggestion of B.C. Law are more tenable. In
<div n="lb"/>the Nepāla Vaṃśāvalī, the Licchavis are allotted to the Sūrya-
<div n="lb"/>vaṃśa or solar race of the kṣatriyas.<sup>228</sup> This is quite in agree-
<div n="lb"/>ment with the fact elicited from the Buddhist records that they
<div n="lb"/>were Vāsiṣṭhas by {%Gotra,%} for we know from the Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>229</sup> that the {%gotra%} or {%pravara%} (family) of a kṣatriya is
<div n="lb"/>the same as that of his {%purohita%} or family-priest. The Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>{%gotra%} was, therefore, the {%gotra%} of their family priest, and we
<div n="lb"/>know that the Vasiṣṭhas were the family priests of the kings of
<div n="lb"/>the solar race, especially of the Ikṣvākus.<sup>230</sup>

<L>324<pc>143<k1>madrakas<k2>madrakas
11. {%Madrakas%}¦ (No. I, L. 22):
<div n="lb"/>One of the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta. We also know
<div n="lb"/>of Madra as a personal name in No. 15, L. 8.
<div n="P"/>Madras claimed descent from an eponymous king Madraka,
<div n="lb"/>son of Śibi Auśīnara, and were septs of the family of Śivi
<div n="lb"/>like the Kaikeyas.<sup>231</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Dr. Buddha Prakash ‘Bhadra’ was another
<div n="lb"/>Variant of Madra.<sup>232</sup> But this view is not acceptable to us.
<div n="lb"/>The Mahābhārata<sup>233</sup> mentions the Bhadras, but only in the
<div n="lb"/>Bombay recension; the Calcutta recension has Madra.<sup>234</sup> We
<div n="lb"/>know that Bhadra and Madra had independent existence, as
<div n="lb"/>found in the legend of Bhadrā Kākṣīvatī, bride of Vyuṣi-
<div n="lb"/>tāśva.<sup>235</sup> The queen had seven children, three Śālvas and
<div n="lb"/>four Madras. <sup>236</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Candravṛtti on Candra<sup>237</sup> informs us that Udumbara,
<div n="lb"/>Tilakhala, Madrakāra, Yugandhara, Bhuliṅga and Śaradaṇḍa,
<div n="lb"/>are the divisions of Sālva (or Śālva). The word Śālva literally
[Page-144+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>means an animal like stag or gazelle which bespeaks of
<div n="lb"/>Scythian origin.<sup>238</sup> Buddha Prakash connects it with the
<div n="lb"/>modern sub-caste Saluja (Skt. Sālvaja). Anyhow, we know that
<div n="lb"/>Madras were a branch of Śālvas who were sons of Bhadra.
<div n="lb"/>J. Przyluski<sup>239</sup> considers the Madras to have been a section of
<div n="lb"/>the Bhadras on the ground that the former had among their
<div n="lb"/>ancestress a queen named Bhadrā. Both the Bhadras and the
<div n="lb"/>Madrakas are mentioned separately in the Bṛhatsaṃhitā,<sup>240</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>Bhadras with the Śālvas in the Madhyadeśa (Middle land)
<div n="lb"/>and the Madrakas with the Mālavas in the northern quarter.
<div n="P"/>Nakula and Sahadeva were the sons of Pāṇḍu by his
<div n="lb"/>wife Mādrī. The name of their mother Mādrī suggests their
<div n="lb"/>connection with the clan of the Madras.<sup>241</sup> Since Bālhiki
<div n="lb"/>(Bāhlika stands for the Bactrians) was the title of Mādrī,
<div n="lb"/>Madras were of Irano-Bactrian origin; the Madras may rep-
<div n="lb"/>resent the Iranian tribe, Māda or Mede.<sup>242</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Madras were an ancient kṣatriya tribe.<sup>243</sup> We do not
<div n="lb"/>find their mention in the early Vedic Saṃhitās but the Vaṃśa
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa (of the Sāmaveda) tells us of a Vedic teacher named
<div n="lb"/>Madra-gāra Śauṅgāyani (‘descendant of Śuṅga’) whose pupil
<div n="lb"/>was Kāmboja Aupamanyava.<sup>244</sup> Zimmer<sup>245</sup> concludes, with pro-
<div n="lb"/>bability, that these names point to a connexion of the Kambojas
<div n="lb"/>and the Madras. We know from the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>246</sup>
<div n="lb"/>that the Madra country was the chief centre of Vedic learning.
<div n="lb"/>We know of a Kāpya Patañcala amongst the Madras who
<div n="lb"/>was a famous teacher of Vedic lore.<sup>247</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Uttara Madras, the ‘northern Madras’ are referred
<div n="lb"/>to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>248</sup> as living beyond the Himalaya
<div n="lb"/>({%pareṇa himavantam%}) in the neighbourhood of the Uttara
<div n="lb"/>Kurus, probably, as Zimmer<sup>249</sup> conjectures, in the land of
<div n="lb"/>Kashmira. The Madras mentioned in the Upaniṣads were, like
<div n="lb"/>the Kurus, probably settled somewhere in Kurukshetra in the
<div n="lb"/>Madhyadeśa or ‘Middle Land’.<sup>250</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pāṇini<sup>251</sup> mentions two divisions of the Madras, Pūrva
<div n="lb"/>(eastern) and Apara (Western). In the Bṛhatsaṃhitā they are
<div n="lb"/>mentioned twice; firstly as Madra situated in West in Vāyavya
<div n="lb"/>Koṇa,<sup>252</sup> and secondly as Madraka with Mālava in the
<div n="lb"/>North.<sup>253</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Rāmāyaṇa, we read that Sugrīva sent monkeys to
[Page-145+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>the Madrakas and other tribes in quest of Sītā.<sup>254</sup> The Madra
<div n="lb"/>tribe or kingdom<sup>255</sup> is mentioned in the Bhīṣmaparvan of the
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata (chap. IX) and in Pāṇini's grammar (II, 3, 73;
<div n="lb"/>IV, 4, 67). The Madras held the Central portions of the
<div n="lb"/>Punjab;<sup>256</sup> they appear in the Epic period to have occupied
<div n="lb"/>the district of Sialkot, between the rivers Chenab and Ravi,<sup>257</sup>
<div n="lb"/>or according to some between the Jhelum and the Ravi.<sup>258</sup>
<div n="lb"/>S.B. Chaudhuri<sup>259</sup> says that the Madras held the portion in
<div n="lb"/>the Doab between the Chenab and the Ravi, possibly com-
<div n="lb"/>prising even a portion of the country between the Jhelum and
<div n="lb"/>the Chenab, and thus abutted on Kaikeya on the West.
<div n="lb"/>We get a clue to the inhabitance of the Madras from a verse
<div n="lb"/>in the Karṇaparvan of the Mahābhārata<sup>260</sup> which refers to a
<div n="lb"/>Madra, who had come to live among the Kurus, as yearning
<div n="lb"/>for his return to his native place beyond the Śatadru and the
<div n="lb"/>Irāvatī to enjoy the company of charming women.
<div n="P"/>Śākala (Pali-Sagala, modern Sialkot) was the capital of the
<div n="lb"/>{%Madras%} identified<sup>261</sup> with Sanglawala-Tiba, to the West of the
<div n="lb"/>Ravi. From the Milinda-pañho, we learn that king Milinda
<div n="lb"/>(Menander) a Graeco-Bactrian king, who became a convert to
<div n="lb"/>Buddhism, was ruling over the Madda country with Sagala as
<div n="lb"/>his capital which according to a Buddhist lexicon, was one of
<div n="lb"/>the twenty ancient cities.<sup>262</sup> The brahminical name<sup>263</sup> of the
<div n="lb"/>Madra Capital was Śākala mentioned by Pāṇini<sup>264</sup> as Sānkala.
<div n="lb"/>In the Mahābhārata<sup>265</sup> and the Jātakas<sup>266</sup> Śākala is described
<div n="lb"/>as standing on the bank of the Āpagā in a tongue of land
<div n="lb"/>between two rivers, called the Śākaladvīpa, which corresponds
<div n="lb"/>to the Rechna Doab.
<div n="P"/>We know from the Mahābhārata about Śalya, king of the
<div n="lb"/>Madras (Madrarāja). <sup>267</sup> After severe fighting, and many
<div n="lb"/>vicissitudes, the Madra soldiers were killed by Arjuna.<sup>268</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Madras are mentioned in the Purāṇas as well.<sup>269</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu Purāṇa<sup>270</sup> refers to the Madras along with the Ārāmas,
<div n="lb"/>Pārasīkas, and others and in the Matsya Purāṇa<sup>271</sup> with
<div n="lb"/>Gāndhāra, Yavana and others. The latter<sup>272</sup> mentions king
<div n="lb"/>Aśvapati of Śākala in the kingdom of the {%Madras.%}
<div n="P"/>The {%Madras,%} according to the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya<sup>273</sup>
<div n="lb"/>were a corporation of warriors and people enjoyed the title of
<div n="lb"/>{%rājan (rājaśabdopajīvinaḥ).%}<sup>274</sup>
[Page-146+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Madra women were noted for their beauty. <sup>275</sup> The Jātakas
<div n="lb"/>bear ample testimony to the fact that the Madra princesses
<div n="lb"/>were sought in marriage by the great kṣatriya house of North
<div n="lb"/>India.<sup>276</sup> The Mahābhārata tells us that it was a family custom
<div n="lb"/>of the {%Madras%} to receive a fee from the bridegroom when they
<div n="lb"/>gave their daughters in marriage.<sup>277</sup>
<div n="P"/>Some scholars identify the {%Madras%} with Vāhlika (or
<div n="lb"/>Vāhīka).<sup>278</sup> Śākala as a Vāhīkagrāma is also mentioned by
<div n="lb"/>Patañjali.<sup>279</sup> From the references in the Mahābhārata, Vāhīka
<div n="lb"/>would appear to have stood for the whole of Punjab.<sup>280</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Vāhīka-grāmas of Śākala and Pātanaprastha, as referred to
<div n="lb"/>in the grammatical works,<sup>281</sup> imply the inclusion of {%Madra-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%janapada%} in the Vāhīka country.
<div n="P"/>The {%Madras%} are known as low, barbarous<sup>282</sup> and sinful
<div n="lb"/>people.<sup>283</sup> They are mentioned as base, impure and contemp-
<div n="lb"/>tible.<sup>284</sup> “Amongst the Madrakas all acts of friendship are
<div n="lb"/>lost”<sup>285</sup> and so it is said: “Neither one should create enmity, nor
<div n="lb"/>friendship with a Madraka”.<sup>286</sup> The Rājataraṅgiṇī also records
<div n="lb"/>similar views.<sup>287</sup>
<div n="P"/>But the advent of the {%Jarttikas%} or {%Jartas%} (modern Jāṭs) who
<div n="lb"/>spread over the whole of Punjab was responsible for the degene-
<div n="lb"/>ration of the Madras.<sup>288</sup> The legend of Sāvitrī and Satyavan
<div n="lb"/>is connected with the Madra country, for Sāvitrī was the
<div n="lb"/>daughter of Aśvapati, king of Madra.<sup>289</sup> In the Udyogaparvan
<div n="lb"/>the camp of Śalya is described as full of warriors, whose strange
<div n="lb"/>armours, bows and banners, unfamiliar trappings, vehicles and
<div n="lb"/>equipment and local costumes, ornaments and deportment
<div n="lb"/>presented a unique spectacle in the country of the Kurus. <sup>290</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the early part of the sixth century A.D. the Madra
<div n="lb"/>country passed under the rule of the Hūṇa conqueror Mihira-
<div n="lb"/>kula (A.D. 515-535) who ruled from Sialkot. The Madras
<div n="lb"/>continued to flourish even up to the time of the Pāla king
<div n="lb"/>Dharmapāla in the 9th century A.D.<sup>291</sup>

12. {%Mālava%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22; No. 17, L. 19; No. 32, L. 11):
<div n="lb"/>We know Mālava as a tribe which was subjugated along with
<div n="lb"/>some other tribes by Samudragupta (No. 1). No. 17 refers to the
<div n="lb"/>Mālava-gaṇa<sup>292</sup> which has been translated by Fleet as ‘the tribal
<div n="lb"/>constitution of the Mālavas’ in the sense of the event of some
<div n="lb"/>formal establishment of the Mālavas’ as a tribe.<sup>293</sup> Fleet fixes
[Page-147+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>it up as 57-56 B.C.<sup>294</sup> Thomas<sup>295</sup> translates the expression as
<div n="lb"/>“the continuance (sthiti) of the tribal constitution (gaṇa) of
<div n="lb"/>the Mālavas” and adds “It was to {%gaṇa-sthiti,%} not to {%gaṇa,%} that
<div n="lb"/>I gave the meaning of ‘tribal constitution’; and I did not intro-
<div n="lb"/>duce the idea of ‘Continuance’.” My amended translation is
<div n="lb"/>“the usage of the Mālava tribe.”<sup>296</sup> Thus the expression {%‘Māla-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vānām gaṇa’%} refers to the Mālavas as a tribe. No. 32 speaks of
<div n="lb"/>the Mālava-vaṃśa which has been translated as ‘the race of
<div n="lb"/>the Mālavas,<sup>297</sup> but it would be better to translate it as “the
<div n="lb"/>dynasty of the Mālavas”.<sup>298</sup> It seems that this tribe had esta-
<div n="lb"/>blished independent rulership and so we find the word {%‘vaṃśa’%}
<div n="lb"/>used where the word {%‘gaṇa’%} could also be used<sup>299</sup>
<div n="P"/>Dr. Buddha Prakash holds that Madras and Mālavas were
<div n="lb"/>the same, in Prakrit Madra becomes Malla, as {%‘dra’%} is changed
<div n="lb"/>into {%‘ll’.%} He identifies {%Malla%} with the Malloi of the Greeks
<div n="lb"/>and Mālava of the Epic. He points out that the sons of Aśva-
<div n="lb"/>pati, king of the Madras, were called Mālavas after their
<div n="lb"/>mother, according to decree of Yama which shows that Madra
<div n="lb"/>and Mālava were identical.<sup>300</sup>
<div n="P"/>But we venture to disagree with the learned scholar. The
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhatsaṃhitā mentions Madraka and Mālava separately but
<div n="lb"/>side by side as people of the North.<sup>301</sup>
<div n="P"/>At the time of Samudragupta, the Mālavas possibly lived in
<div n="lb"/>Rajasthan and West Malwa<sup>302</sup> consisting of Mewar, Tonk and
<div n="lb"/>adjoining regions of south-east Rajasthan.<sup>303</sup> They setteled in
<div n="lb"/>various localities in Western India after having migrated from
<div n="lb"/>the Punjab where they had fought with Alexander on the lower
<div n="lb"/>banks of Ravi.<sup>304</sup> Their original home was in Jhang District,
<div n="lb"/>Punjab. <sup>305</sup> Subsequently they became the inhabitants of Malwa
<div n="lb"/>and the Vikrama era derived its original appellation from
<div n="lb"/>them.<sup>306</sup> That the Mālavas had migrated to the Jaipur region
<div n="lb"/>(Rajasthan) from the Punjab is supported by the fact that the
<div n="lb"/>legend on some Mālava coins found in Rajasthan reads from
<div n="lb"/>right to left as in Kharoṣṭhī, which was prevalent in the
<div n="lb"/>Punjab and the north-west from very early times.<sup>307</sup> The Sikhs
<div n="lb"/>of Ferozpur, Ludhiana, Patiala, Jind and Malerkotala are
<div n="lb"/>still known as Mālava Sikhs, probably, because these regions
<div n="lb"/>were populated by the Mālavas in ancient times.<sup>308</sup> Mālava
<div n="lb"/>and Mālavaka are also to be differentiated, the former is
[Page-148+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Mālava proper while the latter is lesser Mālava with the diminu-
<div n="lb"/>tive suffix {%‘ka’.%}<sup>309</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mālava is the same as {%Malloi%} of the Greeks.<sup>310</sup> Pāṇini does
<div n="lb"/>not mention them by name, but his sūtra, V. 3. 117 speaks of
<div n="lb"/>{%‘āyudhajīvī saṃghas’,%} or tribes living by the profession of arms,
<div n="lb"/>and the Kāśikā says that amongst these saṃghas were the
<div n="lb"/>Mālavas and Kṣudrakas.<sup>311</sup> The Mālava tribe is actually men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned in the Mahābhaṣya of Patañjali.<sup>312</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhārata couples the Mālavas with the Tri-
<div n="lb"/>garttas,<sup>313</sup> as well as with the Śivis and Ambaṣṭhas.<sup>314</sup> But
<div n="lb"/>soon they migrated southwards and settled somewhere in Rajas-
<div n="lb"/>than where we find them at the time of Samudragupta.<sup>315</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Many coins found at Nagar, 45 miles north of Kota, have the
<div n="lb"/>legend. {%“Mālavānām jayaḥ”%} (victory of the Mālavas) in letters
<div n="lb"/>belonging to the period from 250 B.C. to A.D. 250. According
<div n="lb"/>to Cunningham these coins show that the existence of the
<div n="lb"/>Mālavas as a recognised and important clan, long before their
<div n="lb"/>tribal constitution led to the establishment of their era.<sup>316</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Mālavas came into conflict with Nahapāna's son-in-law Uṣava-
<div n="lb"/>dāta who subdued them.<sup>317</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to the Purāṇas<sup>318</sup> the Mālavas are associated with
<div n="lb"/>the Saurāṣṭras, Avantis, Ābhīras, Śūras, and Arbudas, dwell
<div n="lb"/>along the Pariyātra mountains. Thus they seem to have occupi-
<div n="lb"/>ed other territories besides the Punjab or Rajasthan. Pargiter
<div n="lb"/>points out that even according to the Purāṇas the Mālavas
<div n="lb"/>lived in a ‘mountanious’ country, and were nowhere near pre-
<div n="lb"/>sent Malwa. Mālava king were taken as vrātya and mostly
<div n="lb"/>śūdra in the Purāṇas.<sup>319</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bhīṣmaparvan of the Mahābhārata mentions the western
<div n="lb"/>(pratīcya) and northern ({%udīcya%}) sections of the Mālavas.<sup>320</sup>
<div n="lb"/>But the Rāmāyaṇa locates the Mālavas in the east. <sup>321</sup> Kāma-
<div n="lb"/>sūtra's commentator Jayamaṅgala, who flourished later than
<div n="lb"/>the fourteenth century, says that Āvantika, which is identical
<div n="lb"/>with Ujjayinī-deśa, is {%apara-Mālava.%}<sup>322</sup> This has led some
<div n="lb"/>writers to suggest that Mālava proper is Daśārṇa. But Jaya-
<div n="lb"/>maṅgala's geographical knowledge was not perfect.<sup>323</sup> His
<div n="lb"/>remark on Mālava is to be rejected as it runs counter to earlier
<div n="lb"/>authorities. Rājaśekhara mentions Mālava, Avanti and Vidiśā
<div n="lb"/>and the Mañjūśrī mentions Mālava, Vidiśā and Daśārṇa side
[Page-149+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>by side<sup>324</sup> Modern Malwa is the region around Ujjayinī and
<div n="lb"/>Bhilsa. The influence of the Mālavas in the Mandasor region is
<div n="lb"/>proved by the fact that they could impose their tribal era upon
<div n="lb"/>the Mandasor princes.<sup>325</sup> An inscription describes the subjuga-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Sapta-Mālava by Daṇḍanāyaka Anantapāla, a feudatory
<div n="lb"/>of Vikramāditya VI.<sup>326</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Harṣacarita of Bāṇa refers to the ‘wicked Mālava king’
<div n="lb"/>generally identified with Devagupta, who killed Grahavarman
<div n="lb"/>Maukhari, but was himself defeated by Rājyavardhana.
<div n="lb"/>B.C. Law places the kingdom of Devagupta between Prayāga
<div n="lb"/>and Bhilsa which is identical with Pūrva-Mālava.<sup>327</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus the Mālavas originally belonged to Jhang District
<div n="lb"/>in Punjab (now in Pakistan), from where they spread all
<div n="lb"/>over Punjab and by the time of Samudragupta had migrated
<div n="lb"/>to Rajasthan. The Mālavas had emerged in 250 B.C. as an
<div n="lb"/>independent tribal state. But they came under the subservience
<div n="lb"/>of the Śakas in the Ist century B.C., to the western kṣatraps
<div n="lb"/>from the 2nd to the 4th centuries A.D. and to Samudragupta
<div n="lb"/>in the 4th century A.D., but this typical native state exerted
<div n="lb"/>itself again.<sup>328</sup> In the period after about A.D. 550 they seem to
<div n="lb"/>have migrated further to the east and covered the region from
<div n="lb"/>Bhilsa (Eastern Malwa) to Prayāga.<sup>329</sup> During the rule of the
<div n="lb"/>Pālas of Bengal they seem to have migrated still further east;
<div n="lb"/>for the copper plates of the Pāla kings (excepting Dharmapāla),
<div n="lb"/>refer to the Mālavas as mercenary troops in their army.<sup>330</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name of the tribe survives in the modern province of
<div n="lb"/>Malwa (a transformation of the word Mālava), and in the brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa castes called ‘Mālavīs’ or ‘Mālavikas’. They are the brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇas of Mālava proper and the adjoining country, but are found
<div n="lb"/>also in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.<sup>331</sup>

13. {%Mleccha%}¦ (No. 14, L. 4):
<div n="lb"/>According to Sircar<sup>332</sup> Fleet conjectures the reading to be
<div n="lb"/>Mleccha. The last few letters in line 4 after {%‘ni’%} are not legible.
<div n="lb"/>So how Fleet could take this reading without putting any
<div n="lb"/>doubt is really surprising. Mlecchas were amongst the enemies
<div n="lb"/>defeated by Skandagupta in this inscription (No. 14). The war
<div n="lb"/>with the Mlecchas probably refers to his fight with the Hūṇas
<div n="lb"/>which is specifically referred to in the Bhitari Pillar Inscription.
<div n="lb"/>Whether the Mlecchas are the same as Hūṇas or were a
[Page-150+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>different tribe, both the records (No. 13, No. 14) claim that
<div n="lb"/>Skandagupta completely defeated these enemies.<sup>333</sup> The fact
<div n="lb"/>that in both the inscriptions, the reference to the fight with the
<div n="lb"/>Hūṇas and Mlecchas is preceded by a reference to the falling
<div n="lb"/>fortunes of the family supports the identification.
<div n="P"/>We also find a reference to the oppression of the earth by
<div n="lb"/>the Mlecchas in the epilogue of the play {%Mudrā-Rākṣasa%} written
<div n="lb"/>by Viṣākhadatta where it is prayed that ‘The earth may now be
<div n="lb"/>protected by “His Highness” along with relatives and retinue
<div n="lb"/>by king Candragupta’. It is probable that the play was written
<div n="lb"/>after the Rāmagupta episode and probably the word Mleccha
<div n="lb"/>in this context alludes to the Śakas who were suppressed by
<div n="lb"/>Candragupta II in the guise of the Gupta queen Dhruvasvāminī.
<div n="P"/>D.C. Sircar<sup>334</sup> is of the view that Mleccha is the name
<div n="lb"/>applied to the Muhammadans and other foreigners. In the
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit language originally there does not appear to have
<div n="lb"/>been any general term for a foreigner. But as the {%Dāsa, Dasyu,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Barbara,%} and {%Mleccha%} became more or less absorbed in Āryan
<div n="lb"/>civilization and the original specific meaning of these terms
<div n="lb"/>was no longer remembered, these words came to be used for
<div n="lb"/>any foreigner.<sup>335</sup>
<div n="P"/>The word Mleccha was used to refer to both the eastern and
<div n="lb"/>western Ānavas. In course of time it came to be used for almost
<div n="lb"/>any non-Āryan and even for Āryans of impure speech. Subse-
<div n="lb"/>quently the term meant something like “foreigner”, but that was
<div n="lb"/>after most of the Ānavas had become assimilated.<sup>336</sup> When not
<div n="lb"/>used in association with the foreigners the word Mleccha is
<div n="lb"/>used for one who is impure, dirty or uncultured. It is derived
<div n="lb"/>from the root {%§mlich~mlech,%}<sup>337</sup> meaning to speak indistinctly
<div n="lb"/>(like a foreigner or barbarian who does not speak Sanskrit).
<div n="lb"/>We find the use of root in Mahābhāṣya.<sup>338</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Sanskrit term Mleccha, referring to the indistinct
<div n="lb"/>speech of some non-Āryans, is taken from proto-Bodish (proto-
<div n="lb"/>Tibetan) {%mltśe%} “tongue”, Old Bodish {%ltśe,%} Kukish generally
<div n="lb"/>{%mlei,%} the combination of initial consonants ({%mltś%} — ) being
<div n="lb"/>simplified in various ways in different Tibeto-Burmic languages.
<div n="lb"/>Aspiration cannot occur after {%I%} in old Bodish; and the proto-
<div n="lb"/>Bodish form may have been {%mltse%} for all we know, so the {%‘cch’%}
<div n="lb"/>of Sanskrit “Mleccha may come nearer the primitive affricate
[Page-151+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>than anything preserved in the Tibeto-Burmic languages.
<div n="lb"/>Since {%‘mleche’%} would be an impossible combination in Sanskrit,
<div n="lb"/>{%mleccha%} would be as close as a Sanskrit speaker could come to
<div n="lb"/>it”.<sup>339</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mleccha<sup>340</sup> occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>341</sup> in the
<div n="lb"/>sense of a barbarian in speech. Here the brāhmaṇas are for-
<div n="lb"/>bidden to use barbarian speech. The example<sup>342</sup> given of such
<div n="lb"/>speech is {%“he' layo”,%} explained by Sāyaṇa as {%“he' rayaḥ”,%} “ho,
<div n="lb"/>foes”. The barbarians referred to were Āryan speakers, though
<div n="lb"/>not speakers of Sanskrit, but of a Prakrit form of speach.<sup>343</sup>
<div n="P"/>An ancient tradition regards the Andhras, Pulindas and
<div n="lb"/>Śabaras as dog-eaters or Mlecchas.<sup>344</sup> The Jain Prajñāpanā
<div n="lb"/>records two divisions of the people of India — {%Milikkha%} and
<div n="lb"/>Ārya, and enumerates 53 people in the former group, some of
<div n="lb"/>which are the Saga, Javana, Sabara, Vavvara, Hoṇa, Romaya,
<div n="lb"/>Pārasa and Khasa.<sup>345</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhārata<sup>346</sup> states that the Mlecchas dwelt in the
<div n="lb"/>Yavana, Cīna and Kamboja countries. In a dual between
<div n="lb"/>Karṇa and Śalya, Karṇa highly condemns the people of the
<div n="lb"/>Vāhīka and especially of the Madra Country and describes
<div n="lb"/>them as the Mleccha, the dirt among the human beings.<sup>347</sup>
<div n="lb"/>They belong to unpious countries and are totally ignorant
<div n="lb"/>about the Dharma (righteous conduct).<sup>348</sup> At another place,
<div n="lb"/>it is stated that the Yavanas are the Mlecchas, though they
<div n="lb"/>follow their own ways (i. e. not following the Vedic Orthodoxy)
<div n="lb"/>yet they are full of knowledge and brave but the Vāhīkas and
<div n="lb"/>the Madras are condemned as utterly foolish.<sup>349</sup> This makes it
<div n="lb"/>clear that the people not following the righteous conduct
<div n="lb"/>according to the Āryan beliefs, whether indigenous or foreign,
<div n="lb"/>were labelled as the Mlecchas. The Mahābhārata<sup>350</sup> shows that
<div n="lb"/>the coastal regions were the favourite resort of the Mlecchas
<div n="lb"/>and that they were dreadful. The Epic describes the Mlecchas
<div n="lb"/>as being impure because they were of bovine extraction and
<div n="lb"/>describes them as fierce and cruel.<sup>351</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the {%Manu-Smṛti%}<sup>352</sup> the king is advised to exclude at
<div n="lb"/>deliberation time, the foolish, dumb, blind, and deaf, birds,
<div n="lb"/>the aged, women; the Mlecchas (the impure), diseased and
<div n="lb"/>deformed. At another place in the {%Manu-Smṛti%} where the girls
<div n="lb"/>bearing the names after a star, a tree, (or) a river, one called
[Page-152+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>after the {%Antyas%} or a mountain, one called after a bird, snake,
<div n="lb"/>or slave or with a terrifying name are forbidden for marriage,
<div n="lb"/>Kullūka, the commentator on Manu explains the word {%Antya%} as
<div n="lb"/>representing the Mlecchas.<sup>353</sup> From the Manu<sup>354</sup> it is clear
<div n="lb"/>that the Mlecchas spoke a different language than the Āryans.
<div n="P"/>The {%Vāyu, Matsya%} and {%Brahmāṇḍa%} Purāṇas state that the
<div n="lb"/>seven Himalayan rivers pass through the Mleccha countries.<sup>355</sup>
<div n="lb"/>In the {%Varāha Purāṇa,%} a place named Lohārgala is stated to be
<div n="lb"/>ruled over by the Mleccha kings.<sup>356</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Amara-kośa<sup>357</sup> describes the Kirātas, Śabaras and
<div n="lb"/>Pulindas as the {%Mlecchajātis.%} The Bṛhat-Saṃhitā<sup>358</sup> places
<div n="lb"/>them in the West and describes them as unrighteous. It places
<div n="lb"/>them under the jurisdiction of {%Maṅgala graha%}<sup>359</sup> and assigns
<div n="lb"/>them the region of {%Rāhu graha,%} inhabiting the mountain-tops,
<div n="lb"/>low-regions or the caves.<sup>360</sup> In the ‘life’ of Hiuen Tsang, all
<div n="lb"/>places to the north of Lamgham district have been described as
<div n="lb"/>{%Mi-li-ku,%} i. e. frontier or Mleccha lands.<sup>361</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Ārya-mañjūśrī-Mūla-kalpa, the Mlecchas frequently
<div n="lb"/>appear as the companions of robbers.<sup>362</sup> In the Kathāsarit-
<div n="lb"/>Sāgara,<sup>363</sup> the Mlecchas are connected with Sindh. They are
<div n="lb"/>stated to have killed brāhmaṇas, interfered with sacrifices, and
<div n="lb"/>carried off the daughters of hermits.<sup>364</sup> The Rājataraṅgiṇī<sup>365</sup>
<div n="lb"/>mentions the Mlecchas as issuing forth from the valleys adjoin-
<div n="lb"/>ing the Himalayas.
<div n="P"/>In medieval inscriptions, the name Mleccha has been applied
<div n="lb"/>indiscriminately to all foreigners.<sup>366</sup> The Mleccha army of the
<div n="lb"/>Gwalior Praśasti of Bhoja consisted of the Arabs.<sup>367</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Mlecchas of the inscriptions of the medieval period refer to
<div n="lb"/>Muhammadans and the people of Baluchistan.<sup>368</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Siddhānta-Kaumudī<sup>369</sup> describes the {%Kṣudhunas%} as the
<div n="lb"/>Mlecchas. In the Śaktisaṅgama Tantra (a work of the 17th
<div n="lb"/>century), we get reference to the Mleccha (verse 24), Mahām-
<div n="lb"/>leccha (verses 28, 30) and {%Mleccha-mārga%} (verse 31) where they
<div n="lb"/>are mentioned along with Pāñcāla, Kāmboja and Bāhlīka and
<div n="lb"/>the Khurāśan country is described as the {%Mleccha-mārga.%}<sup>370</sup>

14. {%Muruṇḍas%}¦ (No. 1, L. 23):
<div n="lb"/>Muruṇḍa is mentioned in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta along with the terms Daivaputra, Ṣāhi Ṣāhān-
<div n="lb"/>uṣāhi and Śaka as one compound expression.<sup>371</sup> Fleet takes
[Page-153+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Śakas and Muruṇḍas as two separate tribes. They were one of
<div n="lb"/>the foreign potentates who came of their own accord to offer
<div n="lb"/>allegiance to Samudragupta.
<div n="P"/>According to Sten Konow {%‘muruṇḍa’%} is the later form of
<div n="lb"/>a Śaka word meaning ‘lord’ or ‘master’. The term ‘Śaka-
<div n="lb"/>Muruṇḍa’ therefore possibly stands for those Śaka lords or
<div n="lb"/>chieftains who were ruling in the regions of Surāṣṭra and
<div n="lb"/>Ujjain at the time of Samudragupta.<sup>372</sup>
<div n="P"/>But we find in the Khoh plates of Mahārāja Sarvanātha
<div n="lb"/>the names ‘Muruṇḍadevī’<sup>373</sup> and Muruṇḍasvāminī<sup>374</sup> which
<div n="lb"/>shows that {%Muruṇḍa%} was the name of a tribe and not a title.
<div n="P"/>On the basis of Khoh plates, Smith<sup>375</sup> suggested that “the
<div n="lb"/>Muruṇḍas may possibly have been settled in the hill country of
<div n="lb"/>Riwa along the Kaimur range or more probably further south
<div n="lb"/>in the Vindhya or north Dekkan or possibly in the Chhota-
<div n="lb"/>nagpur”.
<div n="P"/>According to R.K. Mookerji,<sup>376</sup> the people called here as
<div n="lb"/>the Muruṇḍas are to be distinguished from the Śakas and may
<div n="lb"/>be identified with the Kuṣāṇas, as earlier suggested by Sten
<div n="lb"/>Konow.<sup>377</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know that the term {%Daivaputra%} in the inscription has
<div n="lb"/>been used to refer to the Kuṣāṇa kings, and Śakas are men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned separately. So we cannot equate Muruṇḍas with the
<div n="lb"/>Kuṣāṇas as suggested by R.K. Mookerji.
<div n="P"/>Some scholars regard Muruṇḍa as the name of a powerful
<div n="lb"/>foreign tribe, ruling in the upper Ganges valley.<sup>378</sup> According
<div n="lb"/>to the Chinese authority, the Capital of Meou-lun (a word
<div n="lb"/>equated with Muruṇḍa) was 7,000 li from the mouth of the
<div n="lb"/>Great River, which was undoubtedly the Ganges. Allan is,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, not right in suggesting that the Chinese description
<div n="lb"/>of the capital refers to Pāṭaliputra.<sup>379</sup> Jayaswal took Śaka-
<div n="lb"/>Muruṇḍa to denote the smaller Śaka rulers like the ‘Shalada,
<div n="lb"/>Shaka and the Gadahara chiefs as well as the Western
<div n="lb"/>Satraps’.<sup>380</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Abhidhāna-Cintāmaṇi<sup>381</sup> and the Vaijayantī<sup>382</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>{%Lampākas%} are identified with Muruṇḍas. The {%Lampākas%} are
<div n="lb"/>the same as the {%Lambatai%} of Ptolemy.<sup>383</sup> The Purāṇas,<sup>384</sup>
<div n="lb"/>mention {%Lampākas,%} the people who were residing in {%Lampāka,%}
<div n="lb"/>the modern {%Laghman%} in Afghanistan. Rājaśekhara seems to be
[Page-154+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>referring to Lampāka as Limpaka.<sup>385</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Muruṇḍas seem to be a foreign tribe. Muruṇḍa is
<div n="lb"/>clearly a non-Āryan word and can have no Āryan derivation.<sup>386</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ptolemy (2nd century A.D.) mentions the Muruṇḍas for the
<div n="lb"/>first time under the name {%Moroundai%} and places them on the
<div n="lb"/>western border of the {%‘Gangaridai’.%} They seem to have occu-
<div n="lb"/>pied an extensive territory, probably the whole of North-Bihar
<div n="lb"/>on the east of the Gaṅgā, as far as the head of the delta. They
<div n="lb"/>had six important cities, all to the east of the Gaṅgā: Boraita,
<div n="lb"/>Koryagaza, Kondota, Kelydna, Aganegora and Talarga. These
<div n="lb"/>places are difficult to identify but to Saint-Martin Kelydna
<div n="lb"/>appeared to have some relation with Kālinadī or Kālindī river,
<div n="lb"/>and {%Aganagora%} with {%Aghadip (Agradvīpa)%} on the eastern bank
<div n="lb"/>of the Ganges, a little below Katwa.<sup>387</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Cunningham, the name of the {%Marundai%} is
<div n="lb"/>still preserved in the country of the Muṇḍas, a hill tribe
<div n="lb"/>scattered over Chhota-Nagpur and Central India.<sup>388</sup> But M.S.
<div n="lb"/>Pandey<sup>389</sup> opposes the view on the ground that the Muruṇḍas
<div n="lb"/>dwelt in the north-west with other foreign tribes. The evidence
<div n="lb"/>is strong enough to show that the Muruṇḍas had not spread so
<div n="lb"/>far to the east as to occupy the Chhota-Nagpur region. How-
<div n="lb"/>ever, barbarous and pastoral the Muruṇḍas might have been
<div n="lb"/>before their immigration into India, when they held the sceptre
<div n="lb"/>in their hands they must have been endowed with the quality
<div n="lb"/>and capacity to rule over a people who were highly civilized.
<div n="lb"/>Such a race could hardly have sunk to a position so low as
<div n="lb"/>that of the Muṇḍas of the modern times. Moreover, the
<div n="lb"/>Muṇḍas are a dominant division of the aboriginals of the
<div n="lb"/>Chhota-Nagpur region. Had they been the descendants of the
<div n="lb"/>Muruṇḍas, we should have found them in other parts of
<div n="lb"/>Central India also, and not confined to this small region so far
<div n="lb"/>from their place of origin.<sup>390</sup>
<div n="P"/>M.S. Pandey<sup>391</sup> disagrees with the Puranic account on the
<div n="lb"/>basis that many discrepancies have crept in owing to the mis-
<div n="lb"/>takes of the copyists.

<div n="lb"/>The Bhitari Stone Pillar Inscription<sup>397</sup> records Skandagupta's
<div n="lb"/>victory over a powerful enemy called the Puṣyamitras, who
<div n="lb"/>possessed a strong army and a rich treasury: he (Skandagupta)
<div n="lb"/>placed (his) left foot on a foot-stool which was the king (of

<div n="lb"/>{%Yudhy-amitrān%} in place of {%Puṣyamitrān.%} But, as pointed out by

<div n="P"/>There are several views about the identification of the

<div n="HI"/>(i) Fleet identified them with the people mentioned in the

<div n="HI"/>(ii) V.A. Smith<sup>401</sup> regarded them as a people of the North.

<div n="HI"/>(iv) R.D. Banerji<sup>403</sup> regarded them as the first wave of the
<div n="lb"/>Hūṇas.
<div n="HI"/>(v) N.K. Bhattasali has suggested that the Puṣyamitras
<div n="lb"/>were the descendants of king Puṣyavarmā of Assam.<sup>404</sup>
<div n="P"/>Bhattasali says that a pun (śleṣa) has been used for “the
<div n="lb"/>descendants of Puṣyavarman of Assam who had so long been
<div n="lb"/>{%mitras%} or friends of the Guptas, but had change into foes by
<div n="lb"/>their desire for conquest and had invaded the Gupta empire from
<div n="lb"/>the east and made it totter”. But as remarked by D.C. Sircar,
<div n="lb"/>“there is no grammatical, lexicographical, or literary support,
<div n="lb"/>for this interpretation of the name Puṣyamitra”.<sup>405</sup>
<div n="P"/>Bhattasali opines that Mahendravarman, whom he assigns
<div n="lb"/>to the period A.D. 450 to 490 who performed two horse-sacri-
<div n="lb"/>fices must have been powerful enough to launch an attack on
<div n="lb"/>the Gupta empire in the reign of Skandagupta.

<div n="lb"/>are from A.D. 455 to 467. The period of the rule of
<div n="lb"/>Mahendravarman, however, cannot be so definitely fixed because
<div n="lb"/>we do not possess any dated records of his reign. As a matter
<div n="lb"/>of fact the entire chronology of the kings of Assam can be
<div n="lb"/>settled approximately only by means of synchronisms and rough
<div n="lb"/>calculations. The attack on the Gupta empire by the Varmans
<div n="lb"/>of Assam in the reign of Skandagupta is an impossibility.<sup>406</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Puṣyamitras cannot be a branch of the Hūṇas as held by
<div n="lb"/>R.D. Banerji. The Hūṇas have been mentioned separately in
<div n="lb"/>the Bhitari Inscription.<sup>407</sup> “By whose (Skandagupta's) two
<div n="lb"/>arms the earth was shaken, when he, the creator (of a distur-
<div n="lb"/>bance like that) of a terrible whirlpool, joined in close conflict
<div n="lb"/>with the Hūṇas”. Hoernle's view that “the Puṣyamitras were the
<div n="lb"/>same as Maitrakas who some years later under the leadership
<div n="lb"/>of Bhaṭārka established themselves in Valabhī probably with
<div n="lb"/>the help of the Hūṇa ruler Toramāṇa”;<sup>408</sup> is also not accept-
<div n="lb"/>able as the Maitrakas remained subservient to the Imperial
<div n="lb"/>Guptas from the time of Bhaṭārka to that of Droṇasiṃha.<sup>409</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Therefore, they cannot be the same as Puṣyamitras who rebelled
<div n="lb"/>against Skandagupta.
<div n="P"/>The Purāṇas mention a people called Puṣyamitras, whose
<div n="lb"/>rule commenced after the end of the dynasty of the {%Vindhyakas.%}
<div n="lb"/>In the Viṣṇupurāṇa MSS. consulted by Prof. Wilson we have
<div n="lb"/>the following statement: “and Puṣpamitras, and Paṭumitras
<div n="lb"/>and others to the number of thirteen will rule over Mekalā”.<sup>410</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Prof. Wilson has added the following note, “It seems most
<div n="lb"/>correct to separate the thirteen sons or families of the Vindhya
<div n="lb"/>princes from these Bāhlikas and then from the Puṣyamitras and
<div n="lb"/>Paṭumitras who governed Mekalā, a country on the Nar-
<div n="lb"/>madā”.<sup>411</sup>
<div n="P"/>A similar statement is to be found in the Vāyupurāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>according to which ‘the Puṣyamitras and Paṭumitras are
<div n="lb"/>grouped with the rulers of Mekalā, whose seven kings have not
<div n="lb"/>been named.<sup>412</sup>
<div n="P"/>The mention of {%Vindhyakas,%} evidently a people of the
<div n="lb"/>Vindhya region, and of Mekalā, points to the south rather than
<div n="lb"/>to North. So the view of V.A. Smith that the Puṣyamitras were
<div n="lb"/>a people of the North is not acceptable.
[Page-157+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Thus the view of Fleet that the Puṣyamitras are to be placed
<div n="lb"/>in Central India somewhere in the country along the banks of
<div n="lb"/>the Narmadā, seems to be most reasonable.<sup>413</sup> This is supported
<div n="lb"/>by numismatic evidence, a hoard of coins brought to light by
<div n="lb"/>D.B. Diskalkar,<sup>414</sup> from the village of Bamnala, 24 miles to
<div n="lb"/>the south of the Narmadā, indicates that there was a serious
<div n="lb"/>disturbance of peace in the vicinity of Mekalā, in the middle
<div n="lb"/>of the fifth century A.D. and we may connect it with the rising
<div n="lb"/>of the Puṣyamitras in that region.<sup>415</sup>

<div n="lb"/>Ṣāhānuṣāhis are also mentioned to have paid homage to
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta along with other tribes. The Ṣāhānuṣāhis are
<div n="lb"/>to be identified with the Sassanids or the Sassanian kings. The
<div n="lb"/>title {%‘Sāhānuṣāhi (śahān-śāh)%} has frequently been used by the
<div n="lb"/>Sassanian kings.<sup>417</sup> The contemporary Sassanian emperor was
<div n="lb"/>Shahpur II (A.D. 309-379).<sup>418</sup> The Sassanians are known to
<div n="lb"/>have been the rulers of Persia from A.D. 211 to 651.<sup>419</sup> Accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to tradition the dynasty is named after its founder Sassan.
<div n="lb"/>His son and successor Papaka, seized power by a coup d'etat
<div n="lb"/>against his suzerain, the Parthian king and his accession was
<div n="lb"/>the starting point for a new cra (A.D. 208).<sup>420</sup>
<div n="P"/>Goyal<sup>421</sup> confuses the Sassanians with the Pārasīkas of
<div n="lb"/>Kālidāsa. But they were different from the Pārasīkas. The
<div n="lb"/>Sassanians had founded a powerful kingdom in Persia, but they
<div n="lb"/>had not yet conquered the whole of Persia.<sup>422</sup> The Pārasīkas
<div n="lb"/>of Kālidāsa were the Ṣāhis.<sup>423</sup> Though the possibility of a
<div n="lb"/>Kuṣāṇa-Sassanian coalition may not be ruled out it seems that
<div n="lb"/>at the time of Samudragupta,<sup>424</sup> three kings the Daivaputra (the
<div n="lb"/>Kuṣāṇas), the Ṣāhi (the Persians or the Pārasīkas of Kālidāsa),
<div n="lb"/>and the Ṣāhānuṣāhi (the Sassanians) were ruling indepen-
<div n="lb"/>dently.<sup>425</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash<sup>426</sup> traces the Khatri sub-castes Sahni and
<div n="lb"/>Osahan as the remnants of the title ‘Ṣāhānuṣāhi’. But this is
<div n="lb"/>far-fetched. So far as Sahni is concerned it is to be connected
<div n="lb"/>with Sādhanika the name of an officer in the administration of
<div n="lb"/>the early medieval period.<sup>427</sup>
<div n="P"/>It may be noted that the Sassanian title Śahan-Śāh was
<div n="lb"/>used for the Great Emperor in Mughal period, which usage
<div n="lb"/>continues. In popular parlance the term is used for calling or
[Page-158+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>receiving some person respectively.

<div n="lb"/>The Ṣāhis are said to have paid homage to Samudragupta.
<div n="lb"/>From the appendix it is clear that Daivaputra is not an adjec-
<div n="lb"/>tive of Ṣāhi as Goyal<sup>429</sup> has surmised and has identified it
<div n="lb"/>with Kidāra Kuṣāṇa of the Great Kuṣāṇa family.
<div n="P"/>Daivaputras have been interpreted to denote the Kuṣāṇas;
<div n="lb"/>so Ṣāhis cannot be identified with the Kuṣāṇas. They must
<div n="lb"/>have been an independent and separate tribe, and may be
<div n="lb"/>identified with the Persians mentioned in the Raghuvaṃśa in
<div n="lb"/>connexion with the North-Westren conquests of Raghu.<sup>430</sup>
<div n="P"/>Goyal<sup>431</sup> identifies the Sassanians with the Pārasīkas of
<div n="lb"/>Kālidāsa. But Pārasīkas can never be identified with Sassanians.
<div n="lb"/>The word ‘Pārasīkas’ itself clearly be speaks of the Persians and
<div n="lb"/>is identical with the modern Parasis. Moreover, Ṣāhānuṣāhis
<div n="lb"/>are to be identified with the Sassanians whereas Ṣāhis refer to
<div n="lb"/>the Persians. Even now the king of Persia (Iran) is known as
<div n="lb"/>‘Shāh of Iran’.
<div n="P"/>Ṣāhi is an Iranian or Persian word and seems to have some
<div n="lb"/>relation with Sanskrit root {%§śās%} to rule, which when formed a
<div n="lb"/>noun means ‘a ruler’. <sup>432</sup> The Śāhi dynasty of Kabul was ousted
<div n="lb"/>by the brāhmaṇa minister of the last king. The new dynasty was
<div n="lb"/>also known as the Śāhis and has been mentioned by Al-Beruni
<div n="lb"/>and Kalhaṇa.
<div n="P"/>The word {%Śāha%} or {%Sāhu,%} often used for banias in villages,
<div n="lb"/>is not connected with Ṣāhi or Śāhi but is to be derived from

<div n="lb"/>Inhabitants of Siṃhala or Ceylon. They are mentioned along
<div n="lb"/>with the Daivaputras, Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and Muruṇḍas,
<div n="lb"/>and all (other) dwellers in islands (probably the islands of
<div n="lb"/>Southern Sea such as Jāvā and Sumātrā)<sup>434</sup> who paid homage
<div n="lb"/>to Samudragupta by offering themselves for services, bringing
<div n="lb"/>presents of maidens, praying for charters bearing the imperial
<div n="lb"/>Gupta Garuḍa seal ({%Garutmadaṅka%}) by which they would be
<div n="lb"/>left undisturbed by the emperor in the enjoyment ({%bhukti%}) and
<div n="lb"/>administration ({%śāsana%}) of their respective territories.<sup>435</sup> If
<div n="lb"/>literally interpreted the inscription will suggest that the people
<div n="lb"/>mentioned here were really tributaries under Samudragupta.
[Page-159+ 40]
<div n="lb"/>When we see from the inscription itself that the Tamil states
<div n="lb"/>were left undisturbed, the inclusion of even distant Siṃhala
<div n="lb"/>(Ceylon) and all other islands in this category raises great
<div n="lb"/>doubts about this interpretation, and we shall hardly be justi-
<div n="lb"/>fied in taking the words of the Court-poet in their literal sense
<div n="lb"/>without corroborative evidence.<sup>436</sup> But the question arises that
<div n="lb"/>was the conquest of Tāmraparṇī (Siṃhala) by Aśoka in his
<div n="lb"/>Rock Edict II also a simple boast of this kind?<sup>437</sup>
<div n="P"/>So far as Ceylon is concerned, we have fortunately an
<div n="lb"/>independent evidence of its political relation with Samuda-
<div n="lb"/>gupta.
<div n="P"/>We know that after the death of king Mahāsena (A.D. 334 — 62)
<div n="lb"/>of the Lambakarṇa clan his son Sumeghavarṇa ({%chi-mi-kia-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%po-mo%} = “cloud of merit”) became king of Ceylon who was a
<div n="lb"/>contemporary of Samudragupta ({%San-meou-to-lo-kin-to%}).<sup>438</sup> He,
<div n="lb"/>according to a Chinese text, sent two monks to Bodh-Gayā to
<div n="lb"/>visit the sacred spots, but they were put to great inconvenience
<div n="lb"/>for want of suitable accommodation. To remove this difficulty
<div n="lb"/>for future pilgrims to the holy place, Meghavarṇa decided to
<div n="lb"/>found a monastery there. He accordingly sent a mission to
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta with rich presents and asked for permission,
<div n="lb"/>and the Ceylonese king built a splendid monastery to the north
<div n="lb"/>of the Bodhi tree.<sup>439</sup>
<div n="P"/>By the time of Hiuen Tsang it had developed into a magni-
<div n="lb"/>ficant establishment, with more than 1,000 priests, and the
<div n="lb"/>pilgrim has described the rich decorations and massive grand-
<div n="lb"/>eur of the buildings. Referring to the old history of its
<div n="lb"/>foundation Hiuen Tsang says that the Ceylonese king ‘gave in
<div n="lb"/>tribute to the king of India all the jewels of his country’. “It
<div n="lb"/>is likely that Samudragupta's courtier also regarded the rich
<div n="lb"/>presents as a tribute, and construed the Ceylonese king's
<div n="lb"/>prayer for permission to build a monastery into an ‘application
<div n="lb"/>for charter confirming him in the enjoyment of his territories’,
<div n="lb"/>one of the forms of homage paid by the category of states into
<div n="lb"/>which Siṃhala is included”.<sup>440</sup>
<div n="P"/>Siṃhala is generally identified with Laṅkā. But Varāhami-
<div n="lb"/>hira<sup>441</sup> mentions both of them separately as situated in the
<div n="lb"/>South.
<div n="P"/>Laṅkā has been identified differently by various scholars
<div n="lb"/>with Laṅkā of Madhyadeśa,<sup>442</sup> with Maldives,<sup>443</sup> with the
[Page-160+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>northern part of the Andhra country on the shores of the Bay
<div n="lb"/>of Bengal,<sup>444</sup> and with an island off the south-east Coast of Cey-
<div n="lb"/>lon.<sup>445</sup> All these theories are refuted by S.B. Chaudhuri<sup>446</sup> who
<div n="lb"/>remarks that the assumption that Laṅkā is not Ceylon is gra-
<div n="lb"/>tuitous.<sup>447</sup> He points out that in the Rāmāyaṇa Rāvaṇa while
<div n="lb"/>entreating Sītā to be his wife says: {%“Laṅkānāma samudrasya%}
<div n="lb"/>{%madhye mama mahāpurī sāgareṇa parikṣiptā niviṣṭā... ”%}<sup>448</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Hanuman makes a similar statement in describing the strategi-
<div n="lb"/>cal position of Laṅkā: {%Sthitā pāre samudrasya dūrapārasya.%}<sup>449</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Kālidāsa in his Raghuvaṃśa in connexion with {%‘Purīm Laṅkām’%}
<div n="lb"/>writes: {%“Mahārṇava parikṣepam lankāyāḥ parikhālaghum”.%}<sup>450</sup>
<div n="lb"/>With regard to the bridge built by Rāma Kālidāsa notes: {%sa%}
<div n="lb"/>{%setuṃ bandhayāmāsa plavaṅgairlavaṇāmbhasi.%}<sup>451</sup> In the Skanda
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa<sup>452</sup> and in the Kathāsaritsāgara, we have similar references
<div n="lb"/>to Laṇkā.<sup>453</sup> All these passages point distinctly to the great sea
<div n="lb"/>on the other side of which was situated the great city of Laṅkā.
<div n="P"/>The separate mention of Siṃhala and Laṅkā in many
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit texts is quoted to show that Laṅkā was distinct from
<div n="lb"/>Ceylon.<sup>454</sup> This is hardly convincing for the separate mention
<div n="lb"/>of Mathurā and Śūrasena, Sāketa and Kosala, Gāndhāra
<div n="lb"/>and Takṣaśilā, Avanti and Ujjainī, did not imply any material
<div n="lb"/>geographical difference as they were treated only as convertible
<div n="lb"/>terms in geographical texts of the Purāṇas. In the Puranic
<div n="lb"/>lists, Laṇkā is a territorial name and Siṃhala is an ethnic name.
<div n="lb"/>As the name of a city in the island of Siṃhala, Laṅkā passed
<div n="lb"/>off as a {%dvīpa,%} and the two names were used in the same
<div n="lb"/>geographical sense. A passage in the Rāmāyaṅa runs thus:
<div n="lb"/>{%“Siṃhalān barbarān mlecchān ye ca laṅkānivāsinaḥ”.%}<sup>455</sup> Hiuen
<div n="lb"/>Tsang also mentions {%Seng-ka-lo%} (Ceylon) which included {%Leug-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ka%} (Laṅkā).<sup>456</sup> As pointed out by B.C. Law, the Mahāvaṃśa
<div n="lb"/>and its commentary show that Laṅkādvīpa (the lower portion)
<div n="lb"/>was one of the main divisions of the island of Ceylon.<sup>457</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is a valid presumption, therefore, that the ancient name
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā referred to Ceylon.<sup>458</sup> We may assume further, as seems
<div n="lb"/>very likely, that Laṅkā was the early name of Ceylon and its
<div n="lb"/>literary name as well. Mention is made of {%Laṅkādvīpa%} even in
<div n="lb"/>medieval inscriptions.<sup>459</sup> The Madras museum plates of Jaṭila-
<div n="lb"/>varman refer to the beautiful island of Laṅkā as {%Ilangai.%}<sup>460</sup> Epi-
<div n="lb"/>graphic evidence, however, shows that Siṃhala, another name
[Page-161+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>of ancient Ceylon, was equally well known. Thus the Kanhad
<div n="lb"/>plate of Kṛṣṇa III refers to the island of Siṃhala.<sup>461</sup> In another
<div n="lb"/>inscription the king of Siṃhala is described as waiting on the
<div n="lb"/>shore.<sup>462</sup> In other inscriptions Siṃhala is variously designated
<div n="lb"/>as Siṅgala-deśam,<sup>463</sup> Sīlam<sup>464</sup> and Sihala.<sup>465</sup> All this evidence
<div n="lb"/>favours the suggestion that as territorial names Siṃhala and
<div n="lb"/>Laṅkā were convertible terms, although the latter is also
<div n="lb"/>used as the name of a city. Priaulx remarks and probably,
<div n="lb"/>correctly, that Laṅkā was the old mythological name for
<div n="lb"/>Ceylon, and that later on it was supplanted by Tāmraparṇī,
<div n="lb"/>and subsequently when the Periplus was written, by {%Palaesi-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%mundus%} or {%Palaesimoundon%} which itself was transformed into
<div n="lb"/>{%Salike, Sereṇdiva%} derived from Pali {%Sihala%} or {%Sihala dīpa.%}<sup>466</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The name {%Palaesimoundon%} is very plausibly based on {%“pāre%}
<div n="lb"/>{%samudrasya”,%}<sup>467</sup> in the description given of Laṅkā as noted
<div n="lb"/>above. Ptolemy's Simoundon<sup>468</sup> also refers to that name. But
<div n="lb"/>in Ptolemy's Geography the island is called {%Salike%} which
<div n="lb"/>responds to {%Siele diba%} of {%Kosmas Indicopleustes%}<sup>469</sup> both of
<div n="lb"/>which have their sources in {%Sihalam%} “the Pāli form of Sanskrit
<div n="lb"/>Siṃhala” or Ceylon. To this source may be traced its other
<div n="lb"/>names such as {%Serendib, Zeilan, Sialan,%}<sup>470</sup> the last one yielding
<div n="lb"/>to Ceylon. Marco Polo's {%Seilan%}<sup>471</sup> is a nearer approach to the
<div n="lb"/>modern name. Van-der-turk suggests that the name may have
<div n="lb"/>been derived from {%Sela%} or ‘precious stone’, hence the island
<div n="lb"/>was anciently called {%Ratnadvīpa.%}<sup>472</sup> An Arab historian called
<div n="lb"/>it the “Island of Rubies”. The Chinese name for the island
<div n="lb"/>also implies reference to gems. The name {%Sailān%} also occurs in
<div n="lb"/>the works of Rashiduddin, Hayton and Jordanus.<sup>473</sup> Al-Beruni
<div n="lb"/>called it {%Singaldīb.%}<sup>474</sup> Siṃhala is perhaps so called as once
<div n="lb"/>abounding in lions.<sup>475</sup>
<div n="P"/>We may note here that there are references to another
<div n="lb"/>Siṃhala quite different from Ceylon.<sup>476</sup> It was placed to the
<div n="lb"/>east of Marudeśa and to the south of the Kāmādri. It is evi-
<div n="lb"/>dently in the Punjab-Rajasthan region and reminds us of the
<div n="lb"/>kingdom of {%Siṃhapura%} mentioned by Hiuen Tsang.

<L>333<pc>161<k1>Saka<k2>Saka
20. {%Śaka%}¦ (No. 1, L. 23):
<div n="lb"/>One of the tribes which is said to have paid homage to
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta. As we have already discussed in connexion
<div n="lb"/>with the Muruṇḍas, the expression, ‘Śaka-Muruṇḍa’ should
[Page-162+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>not be translated to mean Śaka-lords. Following Fleet<sup>477</sup>
<div n="lb"/>we may better split the expression into two distinct names,
<div n="lb"/>the Śakas and Muruṇḍas.
<div n="P"/>The Śakas in the time of Samudragupta (4th century A.D.)
<div n="lb"/>must be the Śakas of Western India belonging to the {%Satrapal%}
<div n="lb"/>family of Caṣṭana and Rudradāman. In this period the Śaka
<div n="lb"/>ruler was Rudrasiṃha II and his successor Rudrasiṃha III,
<div n="lb"/>whose coins come up to A.D. 390, was killed by Candragupta
<div n="lb"/>II.<sup>478</sup> Other persons of that nationality were ruling in and
<div n="lb"/>about Sāñcī.<sup>479</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Scyths, whom Indians named as Śakas, were originally
<div n="lb"/>living on the borders of Bactria. A nomadic people called
<div n="lb"/>Yueh-Chih by the Chinese forced them to move from that
<div n="lb"/>place. Eventually in the beginning of the first century B.C., the
<div n="lb"/>Śakas moved on from Bactria to attack first the Parthians of
<div n="lb"/>Iran, and then the Greeks in India.<sup>480</sup>
<div n="P"/>By the middle of the Ist Century B.C. there remained only
<div n="lb"/>a few petty Greek chiefs in India, and the power of the Śakas
<div n="lb"/>reached Mathurā. The Śakas continued the earlier practice
<div n="lb"/>of issuing coins with bilingual legends in Greek and Prakrit.
<div n="lb"/>The earliest Śaka king in India was Maues (about C. 80
<div n="lb"/>B.C.)<sup>481</sup>
<div n="P"/>Towards the close of the first Century A.D., the Sātavāhanas
<div n="lb"/>were pushed out from the North-West Deccan by the invad-
<div n="lb"/>ing Śakas of the Kṣaharāta clan; but the Śatavāhanas under
<div n="lb"/>the greatest of their rulers, Gautamīputra Śātakarṇin recover-
<div n="lb"/>ed their lands about A.D. 130. After this event nothing more
<div n="lb"/>is heard of the Kṣaharātas.<sup>482</sup>
<div n="P"/>Another Śaka dynasty, called the Kārddamaka family but
<div n="lb"/>generally known as the “Western Satraps”, gained control of
<div n="lb"/>Kathiawar and Malwa at about the same time, and ruled
<div n="lb"/>roughly upto A.D. 400, and at the hight of their power govern-
<div n="lb"/>ing much of Rajasthan and Sind also. The greatest ruler of
<div n="lb"/>this dynasty was Rudradāman, who has left the earliest impor-
<div n="lb"/>tant inscription in correct Sanskrit,<sup>483</sup> a long panegyric which
<div n="lb"/>records his martial exploits, and his reconstruction of a great
<div n="lb"/>artificial lake at Girnar in Kathiawar, which had been excava-
<div n="lb"/>ted under Candragupta and improved in the time of Aśoka.
<div n="lb"/>This inscription is among the earliest certainly dated records
[Page-163+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>of ancient India, and proves that Rudradāman was reigning in
<div n="lb"/>A.D. 150.<sup>484</sup>
<div n="P"/>Samudragupta's main effort was in the direction of the
<div n="lb"/>West, where the Śakas had ruled for over 200 years and which
<div n="lb"/>was enriched by the lucrative western trade. The Śakas at
<div n="lb"/>that time controlled Malwa and Kathiawar and were a power
<div n="lb"/>to be reckoned with. ‘Though the Allahabad Pillar Inscription
<div n="lb"/>claims that Samudragupta received homage from “the Śaka
<div n="lb"/>lords”, it is probable that he did not measure swords with
<div n="lb"/>them’.<sup>485</sup> It is clear that the Śaka homage to Samudragupta
<div n="lb"/>was not at all sincere and reliable since it was not tendered
<div n="lb"/>to his successor,<sup>486</sup> and Candragupta II had to conquer the
<div n="lb"/>Śakas once again.
<div n="P"/>There is indeed a tradition that on the death of Samudra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta the Śakas succeeded in shaking the Gupta Empire, and
<div n="lb"/>forced the weak king, Rāmagupta, to conclude a dishonour-
<div n="lb"/>able peace.<sup>487</sup> Most authorities reject the story, and deny the
<div n="lb"/>historicity of Rāmagupta, but the recent discovery of copper
<div n="lb"/>coins bearing his name<sup>488</sup> strengthens the suggestion that
<div n="lb"/>the tradition has a basis of fact.<sup>489</sup>
<div n="P"/>It was Candragupta II (C. 376-415), the son of Samudra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta and younger brother of the shadowy Rāmagupta, who
<div n="lb"/>finally defeated the Śakas, soon after A.D. 388<sup>490</sup> So he is
<div n="lb"/>rightly remembered as {%‘Śakāri’%} ‘the enemy of the Śakas’.<sup>491</sup>
<div n="P"/>The trousers were introduced into India by the Śakas and
<div n="lb"/>seem to have been in vogue among the ruling classes during
<div n="lb"/>the Gupta times, for Gupta kings often appear on their coins
<div n="lb"/>as wearing trousers.<sup>492</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śakas were notorious drinkers. It is said that Cyrus
<div n="lb"/>defeated the Śakas, when they were maddened by wine.<sup>493</sup>
<div n="lb"/>It has been suggested by Buddha Prakash that as a result of
<div n="lb"/>the influence of the Śakas, the vogue for excessive drinking
<div n="lb"/>spread. Strabo<sup>494</sup> speaks of a Bacchanalian festival of the
<div n="lb"/>Persian, in which men and women, dressed in Scythian style
<div n="lb"/>passed day and night in drinking and wanton play.<sup>495</sup> We
<div n="lb"/>know of similar drinking bouts in the Mahābhārata.<sup>496</sup> Prob-
<div n="lb"/>ably the Scythians and the Iranians popularised drinking in
<div n="lb"/>the Punjab. The people of the Gangetic country, sticking to
<div n="lb"/>pristine ideals of moderation did not relish the exotic drink-
[Page-164+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>ing bouts popularised in the Punjab, under Śaka and Persian
<div n="lb"/>influence. Baudhāyana in his Dharmasūtra, Karṇa in the
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata, and the Buddha in his discourses denounced
<div n="lb"/>drinking and laid down a prohibition against it.<sup>497</sup> But all
<div n="lb"/>this is not agreeable since Buddha and Baudhāyana belong to a
<div n="lb"/>period before the coming of the Śakas. Āryans have been
<div n="lb"/>great lovers of drinking. We can find sufficient evidence for
<div n="lb"/>the drinking before Śakas.
<div n="P"/>We may here refer to the Śaka Era (A.D. 78), which is
<div n="lb"/>very popular in India even to-day. Traditionally this era is
<div n="lb"/>known to have been founded by a Śaka king who occupied
<div n="lb"/>Ujjayinī 137 years after Vikramāditya. The era may in fact
<div n="lb"/>have been founded by Kaniṣka. It was certainly used early in
<div n="lb"/>the 2nd Centuary A.D. by the “Western Satraps”, who ruled
<div n="lb"/>Malwa, Kathiawar and Gujarat. Thence, the use of the era
<div n="lb"/>spread through the Deccan and was exported to South-East
<div n="lb"/>Asia.<sup>498</sup> Because of its long association with the Śaka Satraps
<div n="lb"/>the era may have earned its present name.
<div n="P"/>The Śakas came to be included in the category of the mart-
<div n="lb"/>ial classes of ancient India. Manu<sup>499</sup> refers to the warlike
<div n="lb"/>people on the fringes of Āryan civilization, including the
<div n="lb"/>Greeks (Yavana), the Scyths (Śaka), and the Parthians (Pah-
<div n="lb"/>lava), as kṣatriyas who had fallen from grace through their
<div n="lb"/>neglect of the sacred law, but who could be received once more
<div n="lb"/>into Āryan fold by adopting the orthodox way of life and
<div n="lb"/>performing appropriate penitential sacrifices.<sup>500</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śakas were a white-skinned tribe or race of people; in
<div n="lb"/>the legends which relate the contests between Vasiṣṭha and
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra, the Śakas are fabled to have been produced by
<div n="lb"/>the cow of Vasiṣṭha, from her sweat, for the destruction of
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra's army.<sup>501</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash<sup>502</sup> traces the Śaka invasion on the basis
<div n="lb"/>of literary and linguistic considerations.
<div n="P"/>The name of the capital of the {%Madras,%} Śākala, and that of
<div n="lb"/>the region between the Ravi and the Chenab, Śākaladvīpa, are
<div n="lb"/>based on the word Śaka and are indicative of a Śaka invasion.
<div n="lb"/>Likewise, the name of the clan Śākya, to which Buddha
<div n="lb"/>belonged, enshrines a reminiscene of the word Śaka.
<div n="P"/>Moreover, the place-names ending in {%kanthā%} existing in the
[Page-165+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>whole of the Punjab from the Bannu valley to the Kankhala
<div n="lb"/>region and even beyond suggest an intrusion of the Śakas long
<div n="lb"/>before the time of Pāṇini,<sup>503</sup> who is known to have flourished
<div n="lb"/>one century before the invasion of Alexander, the Great.
<div n="lb"/>{%Kanthā%} is a Śaka word for city<sup>504</sup> and is akin to kadhāvara or
<div n="lb"/>kanthāvara of Kharoṣṭhī inscriptions, {%Kand%} of Persian, {%Kanthā%}
<div n="lb"/>of Khotanese, {%Kandh%} of Sogdian, {%Kandai%} of Pushto, {%Kanda%}
<div n="lb"/>or {%Koent%} of the dialect of the Ṛṣikas. It is significant
<div n="lb"/>that the land beyond the Oxus, the {%Urheimat%} of the Śakas,
<div n="lb"/>abounds in {%Kanthā%}-ending place names, such as Samarkand,
<div n="lb"/>Khokand, Chimkand, Tashkand, Panjkand, and Yarkand.
<div n="P"/>The reference to the stepped-well, called {%Śakandhu%} after
<div n="lb"/>the Śakas, together with that worked by Persian Wheel, known
<div n="lb"/>as {%Karkandhu%} after the Karkians, in a vārttika of Katyāyana<sup>505</sup>
<div n="lb"/>also leads to the same conclusion.
<div n="P"/>At the time of Alexander's invasion the Śakas lived at the
<div n="lb"/>north-western borders of India. That this tide of Śaka inva-
<div n="lb"/>sion, descending from the north-west, touched the eastern
<div n="lb"/>extremity of India, is manifest from the traditions of the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas that the Śakas advanced to Ayodhyā during the reign
<div n="lb"/>of King Bāhu and that his son Sagara checked and repelled
<div n="lb"/>them.<sup>506</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Mahābhārata the Śakas are stated to have constitut-
<div n="lb"/>ed along with Cūlikas, Tuṣāras and Yavanas, the right wing
<div n="lb"/>of the Krauñcavyūha formed by Bhīṣma on the sixth day of
<div n="lb"/>the battle. <sup>507</sup> Caraka in his medical treatise<sup>508</sup> refers to them
<div n="lb"/>in the context of Central Asiatic tribes, viz. Bāhlika, Pahlava,
<div n="lb"/>Cīna, Yavana and Śaka.<sup>509</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash also tries to trace the remnants of the
<div n="lb"/>Śakas in modern times.<sup>510</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śakas came into Punjab after the Yavanas or the
<div n="lb"/>Greeks. During their long rule they contributed a great deal
<div n="lb"/>to Indian culture and ultimately became one with the Indian
<div n="lb"/>people.<sup>511</sup> The depth of their influence on Indian society is
<div n="lb"/>manifest from the word {%thakura,%} which implies the ideas of
<div n="lb"/>nobility and divinity and stands for the Rajputs in the Punjab
<div n="lb"/>and is derived from the word {%thagora, taugara%} or {%tukhara.%}<sup>512</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The name {%Tukhāra%} itself survives in the name of the {%Tokhi%}
<div n="lb"/>caste found in the North-West.<sup>513</sup> Another caste called Khosla
[Page-166+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>is a survival of Kusulaka, the surname of the Kṣaharāta
<div n="lb"/>chiefs Liaka Kusulaka and his son Patika Kusuluka. Analogous
<div n="lb"/>to this word is the name of Kuzula Kadphises the first Kuṣāṇa
<div n="lb"/>emperor to advance towards the Punjab. Hultzsch has equated
<div n="lb"/>this word with Turki {%güjlü%} meaning ‘strong’, and Sten Konow
<div n="lb"/>has compared it with Turki {%guzel,%} meaning ‘beautiful’, but
<div n="lb"/>Lüders has shown that it is the name of a family or clan of
<div n="lb"/>the Śakas.<sup>514</sup> So the name of Khosla is a remnant of this
<div n="lb"/>tribe.<sup>515</sup> Besides the Thakuras and Tokhis of the Punjab,
<div n="lb"/>there are caste-groups of {%Soi%} and {%Sikka,%} which are reminiscent
<div n="lb"/>of the Śakas.

21. {%Sanakānīka%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22; No. 3, L. 2):
<div n="lb"/>In Inscription No. 3 it occurs with the short {%‘i’%} in the fourth
<div n="lb"/>syllable, i. e. as ‘Sanakānika’.<sup>516</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Sanakānīkas were also subjugated by Samudragupta
<div n="lb"/>along with other tribes who payed him all kinds of taxes,
<div n="lb"/>obeyed his orders and were coming to perform obeisance.<sup>517</sup>
<div n="lb"/>In the Udayagiri Cave Inscription of Candragupta II, of the
<div n="lb"/>Year 82 (A.D. 401) (No. 3), we know of a Mahārāja of the
<div n="lb"/>‘Sanakānīka’ tribe or family, who was a feudatory of Candra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta II and who is stated to have recorded his gift on a Vaiṣ-
<div n="lb"/>ṇava Cave temple at Udayagiri.<sup>518</sup> Udayagiri is a well-known
<div n="lb"/>hill about two miles to the north-west of Bhilsa, ancient
<div n="lb"/>Vidiśā.<sup>519</sup> Thus we can say that the Sanakānīkas lived in the
<div n="lb"/>neighbourhood of Bhilsa.<sup>520</sup> D.R. Bhandarkar mentions them
<div n="lb"/>to have held the province of Vidiśā but he also locates Gaṇa-
<div n="lb"/>patināga's kingdom (one of the kings subjugated by Samudra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta) in Vidiśā.<sup>521</sup> So his view seems to be inconsistent.
<div n="P"/>It may be noted that the Sanakānīka feudatory chief of
<div n="lb"/>Candragupta II, as well as his father and grandfather, bore the
<div n="lb"/>title Mahārāja. This may suggest that the Sanakānīkas, and
<div n="lb"/>probably other tribes mentioned along with them in the
<div n="lb"/>Allahabad Pillar Inscription were not tribal republics, as is
<div n="lb"/>generally supposed, but were ruled by hereditary chiefs.<sup>522</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name of the grandfather of this Sanakānīka feudatory
<div n="lb"/>chief of Candragupta II, is given as Chagalaga ‘which looks
<div n="lb"/>like a foreign name’;<sup>523</sup> but his father bears a purely Hindu
<div n="lb"/>name: ‘Viṣṇudāsa’. Of course the present chief's name is
<div n="lb"/>illegible in the inscription (No. 3).<sup>524</sup> But considering the trend
[Page-167+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>it may be surmised that his name also was a Sanskrit name.<sup>525</sup>
<div n="lb"/>It seems that the tribe which originally consisted of aboriginal
<div n="lb"/>people was gradually coming under the influence of Sanskrit
<div n="lb"/>culture.

22. {%Vāhlika%}¦ (No. 20, L. 2):
<div n="lb"/>The Meharaulī Pillar Inscription (No. 20) describes the {%dig-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vijaya%} of a king named Candra (i. e. Candragupta II) in the
<div n="lb"/>first verse as stated below: “He, on whose arm fame was
<div n="lb"/>inscribed by the sword, when, in battle in the Vaṅga count-
<div n="lb"/>ries, he kneaded (and turned) back with (his) breast the enemi-
<div n="lb"/>es who, uniting together, came against him; — he, by whom,
<div n="lb"/>having crossed in warfare the seven mouths of the (river)
<div n="lb"/>Sindhu, the Vāhlikas were conquered; — he, by the breezes of
<div n="lb"/>whose prowess the Southern ocean is even still perfumed”.<sup>526</sup>
<div n="P"/>We find various readings of the name Vāhlika in literature
<div n="lb"/>which are: Vāhlika, Bāhlika, Vāhlīka and Bāhlīka. In our
<div n="lb"/>inscription (No. 20) {%‘Vāhlikāḥ’,%} i. e. Vāhlika in plural denotes
<div n="lb"/>the people of Vāhlika i. e. Bactria (modern Balkh) region on
<div n="lb"/>the Oxus in the northern part of Afghanistan.<sup>527</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mislead by a verse in the Rāmāyaṇa,<sup>528</sup> D.R. Bhandarkar<sup>529</sup>
<div n="lb"/>places Vāhlikas in the close proximity of the Vipāśā, the
<div n="lb"/>modern Beas. The reading {%Vāhlīkān%} in the passage quoted
<div n="lb"/>from the Rāmāyaṇa is a mistake for {%Vāhīkān.%} Numerous
<div n="lb"/>passages can be quoted from the Epic, Puranic and classical
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit literature to prove that the Punjab = Pañcanada, ‘the
<div n="lb"/>land of five rivers’, was in ancient times called the Vāhīka
<div n="lb"/>country.<sup>530</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%‘Vāhīka’%} was, in fact, a general term for the whole of
<div n="lb"/>Punjab. We know Śākala as {%Vāhīka-grāma%} from Patañjali and
<div n="lb"/>also {%Pātanaprastha%} which is modern Pathankot by the same
<div n="lb"/>term. Moreover, Vatsyāyana in his Kāmasūtra and Rajaśekhara
<div n="lb"/>in his Kāvya-mīmāṃsā mention the people of Bāhlīka and
<div n="lb"/>Punjab as two separate entities. <sup>531</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is, however, one verse in the Karṇaparvan of the
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata which suggests that Vāhīka was originally the
<div n="lb"/>name of a country or people on the Vipāśā, (the Beas): “In
<div n="lb"/>the Vipāśā, there were two Piśācas named {%Vahi%} and {%Hika;%}
<div n="lb"/>their descendants are called Vāhīkas who are not the creation
<div n="lb"/>of Prajāpati”.<sup>532</sup>
[Page-168+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Later on the sense of the word expanded to cover all the
<div n="lb"/>tribes living in the Punjab. It is interesting to note that the
<div n="lb"/>Māhābhārata sometimes uses the terms Vāhīka, Madra, Jartika,
<div n="lb"/>Āraṭṭa and Pañcanada synonymously. It appears that the lands
<div n="lb"/>of these tribes which lived close to one another became in
<div n="lb"/>course of time moulded into a big kingdom under the powerful
<div n="lb"/>kings of Śākala (Sialkot). As Vāhīka was beyond Kurukshetra
<div n="lb"/>and, therefore, outside the boundary of Brahmāvarta, its ana-
<div n="lb"/>logical connection with the word {%‘bahis’%} may have been another
<div n="lb"/>cause of the expansion of its geographical sense.<sup>533</sup> This is
<div n="lb"/>also reflected in the Vārttikas of Katyāyana who derives the
<div n="lb"/>word ‘Vāhīka’ from {%‘vahis’%} or {%‘bahis’,%} meaning ‘outside’ (the
<div n="lb"/>pale of Āryandom).<sup>534</sup>
<div n="P"/>Some scholars<sup>535</sup> rely on the description of the Bāhlikas
<div n="lb"/>as the offspring of two Piśācas, {%Bahi%} and {%Hika,%} as given in
<div n="lb"/>the Mahābhārata. Buddha Prakash holds that fresh stream
<div n="lb"/>of the Bactrian people which swooped over the Punjab came
<div n="lb"/>to be known as Bālhikas; their name which became a general
<div n="lb"/>designation for the people of Punjab was later corrupted as
<div n="lb"/>Vāhīka.<sup>536</sup> But we have already shown that the two were
<div n="lb"/>separate entities.
<div n="P"/>We know that the Vāhīkas were the people living within
<div n="lb"/>the boundaries of the five rivers including the sixth Sindhu
<div n="lb"/>(Indus),<sup>537</sup> but according to the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription
<div n="lb"/>Candragupta conquered Vāhlikas after crossing the seven
<div n="lb"/>months of the (river) Indus (sapta mukhāni sindhoḥ).<sup>538</sup> So
<div n="lb"/>Vāhlika of our inscription is certainly Balkh in the extreme
<div n="lb"/>north of Afghanistan.<sup>539</sup> Bajpai<sup>540</sup> opposes it on the ground
<div n="lb"/>that Candragupta could not have gone to so far off a place as
<div n="lb"/>Bactria which is situated across the Hindukush and rejects
<div n="lb"/>the older contention of scholars that the Kuṣāṇas were ruling
<div n="lb"/>in Bactria during king Candra's campaign and that he crossed
<div n="lb"/>the Hindukush to crush them.
<div n="P"/>But the view of Bajpai is not tenable since it is clear from
<div n="lb"/>the lines in our inscription<sup>541</sup> that king Candra had conquered
<div n="lb"/>the Vāhlikas after crossing the seven mouths of the river
<div n="lb"/>Indus.
<div n="P"/>So far as the literary evidence is concerned we find that
<div n="lb"/>Bālhika is the name of a people in the Atharvaveda;<sup>542</sup> here
[Page-169+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>the fever (Takman) is called upon to go to the {%Mūjavants,%} the
<div n="lb"/>{%Mahāvṛṣas,%} and the {%Balhikas.%} The Mūjavants are quite certainly
<div n="lb"/>a northern tribe, and though the passage may contain a pun
<div n="lb"/>on Bālhika as suggesting ‘outsider’ (from {%bahis,%} ‘without’),<sup>543</sup>
<div n="lb"/>still there is no doubt that the name was chosen from a northern
<div n="lb"/>tribe.<sup>544</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇā<sup>545</sup> mentions a Kuru king named
<div n="lb"/>Balhika Prātipīya. It seems that Balhika was a descendant of
<div n="lb"/>Pratīpa. But there is no evidence to show why he bore the name
<div n="lb"/>Balhika.<sup>546</sup> He is perhaps the same as Mahārāja Bāhlika Prātī-
<div n="lb"/>peya of the Mahābhārata.<sup>547</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Rāmāyaṇa shows that the Royal Kuru family originally
<div n="lb"/>migrated from the Bāhlīka country. The passage in question<sup>548</sup>
<div n="lb"/>says that Ila, son of the Prajāpati Kardama, who was the king
<div n="lb"/>of the Vāhli country, gave up Bahlika in favour of his son
<div n="lb"/>Śaśavindu, and founded a new city Pratiṣṭhānapura in the
<div n="lb"/>Madhya-deśa, where his other son Pururava Aila continued to
<div n="lb"/>rule. This links up the Ailas, the progenitor of the Kurus, with
<div n="lb"/>the Kardama royal family of Bāhli. H.C. Raychaudhuri<sup>549</sup>
<div n="lb"/>suggests that Kārddama, the name of the ruling family of
<div n="lb"/>Vāhlika, was obtained from the river of that name in Persia,
<div n="lb"/>and thus infers that the home of the Kārddama king is to
<div n="lb"/>be identified with Bahlika or Balkh in Iran. This view was
<div n="lb"/>earlier advocated by Roth<sup>550</sup> and Weber.<sup>551</sup> But Zimmer<sup>552</sup>
<div n="lb"/>rightly shows that there is no need to assume any Iranian
<div n="lb"/>influence.<sup>553</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know Vāhlīka from the Puranic list of peoples<sup>554</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Account of fifty-six countries<sup>555</sup> is interesting as it mentions
<div n="lb"/>them with the Hūṇas, Kauravas, Gāndhāras and Vidarbhas
<div n="lb"/>among others. In the Śaktisaṅgama Tantra<sup>556</sup> Bāhlīka is
<div n="lb"/>described as famous for horses and situated to the east of
<div n="lb"/>Mahāmlechha and beginning with Kamboja. B.C. Law on the
<div n="lb"/>basis of reference in the Mahābhārata<sup>557</sup> places the Vāhlikas
<div n="lb"/>in the neighbourhood of Gandhar and Kamboja.<sup>558</sup>
<div n="P"/>Katyāyana (4th century B.C.)<sup>559</sup> mentions Bāhlāyana and
<div n="lb"/>derives it from the word Bāhli, a country also mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya.<sup>560</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Vāyu Purāṇa, Śiva Purāṇā, Kāvya-Mīmāṃsā of Rājaśe-
<div n="lb"/>khara and the Rāmāyaṇa<sup>561</sup> place the Vāhlika country in the
[Page-170+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>northern division.<sup>562</sup> Bāhlika is the name of a person in the
<div n="lb"/>Viṣṇu-Purāṇa.<sup>563</sup> The Nāṭyaśāstra<sup>564</sup> of Bharata says that
<div n="lb"/>Bāhlikabhāṣā was spoken by the northern people (Udīcyas).
<div n="lb"/>A similar reference is also to be found in the Sāhitya-darpaṇa.<sup>565</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Kāmasūtra of Vatsyāyana,<sup>566</sup> Bāhlīka is grouped
<div n="lb"/>with Strīrājya, which occurs in the list of North-Western divi-
<div n="lb"/>sion. The peculiar custom in Bāhlika of several young men
<div n="lb"/>being married to a single woman as in {%strīrājya (strīrājye ca%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Bāhlike...%}), appears to be an outlandish custom prevaiting
<div n="lb"/>in the regions to the west of India.<sup>567</sup> The Jayamaṅgalā comm-
<div n="lb"/>entary also says that Bāhlīka was in Uttarāpatha.<sup>568</sup>
<div n="P"/>We find the word Vāhlika occurring in the Amara-kośa in
<div n="lb"/>two ways:

<div n="P"/>The Amarakośa shows that Bāhlīka was famous for horses,
<div n="lb"/>saffron and Ferula Asafoetida ({%hiṅgu%}).
<div n="P"/>The reference to saffron leads us to the filaments of saffron
<div n="lb"/>on the banks of Vaṅkṣu (oxus) where Raghu gave defeat to the
<div n="lb"/>Hūṇas as described in Kālidāsa's Raghuvaṃśa.<sup>571</sup> The reading
<div n="lb"/>Sindhu of the passage<sup>572</sup> is plainly a mistake for Vaṅkśu which
<div n="lb"/>is corroborated by Kṣīrasvāmin, the earliest commentator of
<div n="lb"/>Amara who clearly shows that the Bāhlīka country was border-
<div n="lb"/>ed on the Oxus.<sup>573</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>574</sup> places Bāhlīkas in the jurisdiction of
<div n="lb"/>the Sun. Ancient tradition connects the Bāhlikas with the
<div n="lb"/>Dhārṣṭakas, a Kṣatriya clan which occupied the Bāhlīka
<div n="lb"/>country.<sup>575</sup> We know that Bāhlīkī was another name of Mādrī,
<div n="lb"/>queen of the Madras.<sup>576</sup>
<div n="P"/>Buddha Prakash suggests that the Vedic school of the
<div n="lb"/>{%Bhāllavins%} enshrined the memory of the Bāhlīkas; the modern
<div n="lb"/>sub-castes of the Barasarin sub-group of the khatris Bhalla and
<div n="lb"/>Behl represent the ancient Bālhīkas, and the Jāṭ clans of Bhālār
<div n="lb"/>and Bhalerah, found in Multan, the Baloch tribe Bhalkā, liv-
<div n="lb"/>ing in Sindh, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan and the clan
<div n="lb"/>Bhallowana, found in Shahpur, are remnants of the far-flung
<div n="lb"/>Bāhlika tribes.<sup>577</sup> There is a possibility of the Bāhlīkas migrat-
<div n="lb"/>ing from their original home Balkh to the Punjab.<sup>578</sup>
<div n="P"/>When Hieun Tsang visited Balkh, it was a centre of Buddh-
[Page-171+ 40]
<div n="lb"/>ist faith,<sup>579</sup> but after the overthrow of the Sassanid kingdom by
<div n="lb"/>the Arabs, the ancient Bactria along with the adjoining territor-
<div n="lb"/>ies passed under the control of Khorasan, the seat of the
<div n="lb"/>Muhammadan power.<sup>580</sup>

23. {%Yaudheya%}¦ (No. 1, L. 22):
<div n="lb"/>The Yaudheyas are included among the tribes subjugated by
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta. In his time, they seem to have occupied north-
<div n="lb"/>ern Rajputana and south-east Punjab, and their territory
<div n="lb"/>extended up to the confines of the Bahawalpur State where
<div n="lb"/>their name survives in the name of the tract called Johiyawar.<sup>581</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Their earliest reference in the inscriptions is found in the
<div n="lb"/>Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradāman I (A.D. 150)<sup>582</sup>
<div n="lb"/>which mentions the victory of Mahākṣatrapa Rudradāman over
<div n="lb"/>the Yaudheyas who were ‘proud of their heroism’. The Bijaya-
<div n="lb"/>gadh Inscription<sup>583</sup> which is a record of the Yaudheyas (in
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmī characters of the second-third century A.D.)<sup>584</sup> connects
<div n="lb"/>them with Bharatpur State in Rajputana. It refers to one
<div n="lb"/>Mahārāja Mahāsenāpati, the ruler of the Yaudheya-gaṇa.<sup>585</sup>
<div n="P"/>Literally the word {%Yaudheya%} means ‘a warrior’ which corr-
<div n="lb"/>esponds with the {%Ossadü%} of Arrian, the {%Sambastae%} of Diodorus
<div n="lb"/>and the {%Sambracae%} of Curtius, who made their submission to
<div n="lb"/>Alexander.<sup>586</sup> They were a powerful nation and their forces
<div n="lb"/>consisted of 60,000 foot, 6000 horse, and 500 chariots.<sup>587</sup>
<div n="P"/>We get three different versions about the origin of the
<div n="lb"/>Yaudheyas:
<div n="HI"/>(i) In the Mahābhārata<sup>588</sup> it is stated that Yudhiṣṭhira
<div n="lb"/>married the daughter of the Śaivya King Govāsana
<div n="lb"/>named Devikā and begot a son from her named
<div n="lb"/>Yaudheya.
<div n="lb"/>Buddha Prakash<sup>589</sup> and M.K. Sharan,<sup>590</sup> on this basis,
<div n="lb"/>have been tempted to connect the Yaudheyas with
<div n="lb"/>Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest of the Pāṇḍava brothers. D.K.
<div n="lb"/>Gupta questions the foundations of this theory on this
<div n="lb"/>solitary basis in the absence of a more solid or a posi-
<div n="lb"/>tive evidence;<sup>591</sup> but on the other hand he himself has
<div n="lb"/>indulged in connecting the Ārjunāyanas with the epic
<div n="lb"/>hero Arjuna.<sup>592</sup>
<div n="P"/>(ii) The Viṣṇu-Purāṇa gives a contrary view of the same
<div n="lb"/>story. It states that {%Yaudheyī%} was the queen of Yudhi-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭhira from whom he had a son named Devaka<sup>593</sup>
[Page-172+ 39]
<div n="HI"/>(iii) The Harivaṃśa<sup>594</sup> and the Vāyu Purāṇa<sup>595</sup> state that
<div n="lb"/>King Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty had five queens
<div n="lb"/>named Nṛgā or Mṛgā, Kṛmī, Navā, Darvā and Dṛṣad-
<div n="lb"/>vatī who gave birth to five sons named Nṛga, (or Mṛga),
<div n="lb"/>Kṛmi, Nava, Suvrata and Śibi (or Śivi) respectively.
<div n="lb"/>Śibi was the lord of the Śibi people or of the city of
<div n="lb"/>Śivapura, while Nṛga (or Mṛga) was the ruler of the
<div n="lb"/>Yodheyas or of Yaudheyapura. The other three sons
<div n="lb"/>of Uśīnara, viz., Nava, Kṛmi and Suvrata, were the
<div n="lb"/>lords respectively of Navarāṣṭra, Kṛmilāpurī and Amba-
<div n="lb"/>ṣṭhapurī.<sup>596</sup> According to Pargiter, King Uśinara
<div n="lb"/>established the Yaudheyas, Ambaṣṭhas, Navarāṣṭra, and
<div n="lb"/>the city of Kṛmilā, all on the eastern border of the
<div n="lb"/>Punjab; while his famous son Śivi Auśīnara originated
<div n="lb"/>the Śivis or Śrbis in Sivapura.<sup>597</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is very difficult to reject or accept the Puranic tradition
<div n="lb"/>without any further evidence. However, as regards their conne-
<div n="lb"/>ction with Uśīnara, we may say that scholars are somewhat
<div n="lb"/>confused by differing versions by varied text with regard to the
<div n="lb"/>territory ruled over by him.<sup>598</sup> The Ṛgveda, the Jātakas as
<div n="lb"/>well as the accounts of Fahien and Hiuen Tsang connect the
<div n="lb"/>Uśīnaras with a region farther to the north-west in Swat Valley,
<div n="lb"/>a part of the ancient Mahājanapada of Gandhāra; while the
<div n="lb"/>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, the Kauśītakī Upaniṣad and the Kathāsa-
<div n="lb"/>ritsāgara associate them to the region north of Haridwar near
<div n="lb"/>the source of Ganges at Kanakhala.
<div n="P"/>It is possible that originally they were settled in the Swat
<div n="lb"/>Valley but by the passage of time, they migrated to other places
<div n="lb"/>as well. For example, we find that the Śibis were known to
<div n="lb"/>Alexander's followers, living between the Indus and the
<div n="lb"/>Akesines (Chenab).<sup>599</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Mahābhārata,<sup>600</sup> the Yaudheyas are described as
<div n="lb"/>having been defeated by Arjuna, along with the Mālavas and
<div n="lb"/>Trigarttas. In the Sabhāparvan,<sup>601</sup> the Yaudheyas together
<div n="lb"/>with the Śibis and the Trigarttas are represented as having
<div n="lb"/>paid homage to Yudhiṣṭhira. In the Droṇaparvan,<sup>602</sup> we find
<div n="lb"/>that an epithet {%‘Adrija’%} meaning ‘mountain-born’, is used for
<div n="lb"/>the Yaudheyas.
<div n="P"/>The Yaudheyas were one of the republican tribes of the
[Page-173+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Punjab. Pāṇini<sup>603</sup> includes them among the {%āyudhajīvī saṃghas%}
<div n="lb"/>together with the Parśus who are considered to be Persians
<div n="lb"/>by Dr. Buddha Prakash.<sup>604</sup> Pāṇini mentions the Yaudheyas in
<div n="lb"/>another Sūtra also.<sup>605</sup> Kauṭilya also refers to the Yaudheya as
<div n="lb"/>a warrior clan of the Punjab.<sup>606</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>607</sup> places them in the northern division of
<div n="lb"/>India and describes them as being in the region of Bṛhaspati.<sup>608</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Sāhityadarpaṇa of Viśvanātha, they are described as
<div n="lb"/>interested in gambling ({%dīvyatām%}) and speaking the Southern
<div n="lb"/>Vaidarbhī.<sup>609</sup>
<div n="P"/>Yaudheya coins have been found all over the area from
<div n="lb"/>Saharanpur to Multan. In the Ludhiana district have been
<div n="lb"/>unearthed their votive tablets. A rich find of their coin-moulds
<div n="lb"/>was brought to light by B. Sahni at Khokrakot near Rohtak
<div n="lb"/>where there seems to have existed a regular mint.<sup>610</sup> Their
<div n="lb"/>new currency<sup>611</sup> depicting their tutelary deity Kārttikeya which
<div n="lb"/>replaced the Kuṣāṇa currency in these regions, shows that
<div n="lb"/>they played a leading part in the extermination of Śaka rule
<div n="lb"/>in India.<sup>612</sup> The findings of the Yaudheya coins in large num-
<div n="lb"/>ber at Saharanpur, Dehradoon, Delhi, Rohtak and Kangra
<div n="lb"/>attest the fact that they had driven out the Kuṣāṇas from these
<div n="lb"/>areas and had re-established themselves firmly, in the 3rd-4th
<div n="lb"/>century A.D.<sup>613</sup>
<div n="P"/>One of their seals, bearing the legend {%“Yaudheyānām jayam-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%antradharāṇām”%}<sup>614</sup> shows that they were held in high esteem
<div n="lb"/>among the warrior-clans of the Punjab. Some scholars seem
<div n="lb"/>to be confused about its interpretation. Shobha Mukerji<sup>615</sup>
<div n="lb"/>opines that their coins were issued in the name of the gaṇa as
<div n="lb"/>well as the Mantra-dharas. M.K. Sharan<sup>616</sup> explains the word
<div n="lb"/>{%“Mantradhara”%} to mean the members of the Executive Com-
<div n="lb"/>mittee “those vested with the policy of the state”. He is of the
<div n="lb"/>opinion that one set of the Yaudheya coins is struck in the
<div n="lb"/>name of the {%“Mantradharas”%} and the {%“Gaṇa”,%} while the other
<div n="lb"/>set is struck simply in the name of Gaṇa.<sup>617</sup> He seems to have
<div n="lb"/>wrongly substituted the reading {%“Mantradhāra”%} for {%“Mantra-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%dhara”.%} He has been arbitrary in separating {%“Jaya”%} from
<div n="lb"/>{%Mantradharāṇām%}”<sup>618</sup> which forms a compound by the combi-
<div n="lb"/>nation of the two words. Further he rejects the view of some
<div n="lb"/>historians who consider the word {%“Mantradharāṇām”%} to mean
[Page-174+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>‘those who were in possession of Victory Charm’. But he
<div n="lb"/>contradicts himself at another place while explaining a seal<sup>619</sup>
<div n="lb"/>found at Naurangabad with the remarks: “This seal indicates
<div n="lb"/>the bravery of the tribe and that they were never defeated as
<div n="lb"/>they had adopted the title of {#‘jayamantraDarAH’#}”.
<div n="P"/>Actually the expression may mean ‘the Yaudheyas who
<div n="lb"/>knew the secret of victory’. It is symbolic of their victory and
<div n="lb"/>pride that they never got defeated.
<div n="P"/>Another word which has raised some controversy among
<div n="lb"/>the scholars is {%“Darma”%} found on some of the Yaudheya coins.
<div n="lb"/>Some scholars take it to mean Dharma while others take it for
<div n="lb"/>{%‘Dama’%} or {%‘Darma’%} to be a Sanskritised form of Greek —
<div n="lb"/>{%“Drachma”.%}<sup>620</sup> Again some controversy arose whether it was
<div n="lb"/>a Copper one or of silver.<sup>621</sup> The word {%‘Damma’%} or {%‘Dramma’%}
<div n="lb"/>has been used for a gold coin.<sup>622</sup> It may be remarked that the
<div n="lb"/>word borrowed from some foreign language may not strictly
<div n="lb"/>be used in the original sense and hence it may simply mean
<div n="lb"/>coin.<sup>623</sup> The Kuṣāṇas had introduced gold-coins which were
<div n="lb"/>later on adopted by the Guptas. But the Yaudheyas seem to
<div n="lb"/>have never adopted the gold currency since so far we have found
<div n="lb"/>no gold coin belonging to them. This may speak of their weaker
<div n="lb"/>economic condition; surely they could not compare with
<div n="lb"/>powerful monarchies. On some of the Yaudheya coins, we have
<div n="lb"/>the mysterious words, {%“dvi”%} (two) and {%“tri”%} (three) after the
<div n="lb"/>legend {%“Yaudheyagaṇasya jayaḥ”%} which may point out their
<div n="lb"/>making a confederation with other tribes, viz., the Ārjunāyanas
<div n="lb"/>and the Kuṇindas.<sup>624</sup> They seem to have controlled the area
<div n="lb"/>lying on the banks of the river Sutlej up to the borders of the
<div n="lb"/>Bahawalpur State which is still called Johiyawar. The word
<div n="lb"/>{%‘Johiya’%} is apparently an abbreviation of {%‘Jodhiya’,%} which is the
<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit Yaudheya.<sup>625</sup> Cunningham, however, takes the words
<div n="lb"/>{%‘dvi’%} and {%‘tri’%} of the above-mentioned coins to signify ‘the
<div n="lb"/>money of the second and third tribes of the Yaudheyas’.<sup>626</sup>
<div n="P"/>M.K. Sharan<sup>627</sup> has enlisted about twenty-four types and
<div n="lb"/>Symbols on the coins of the Yaudheyas which may point to
<div n="lb"/>their religious leanings as well bear out some aspects of their
<div n="lb"/>social life. They are as follows:
<div n="P"/>1. Bull
<div n="P"/>2. Elephant
[Page-175+ 24]
<div n="P"/>3. Deer
<div n="P"/>4. Peacock
<div n="P"/>5. Tree-in-railing
<div n="P"/>6. Human figure standing (warrior)
<div n="P"/>7. Lakṣmī
<div n="P"/>8. Cobra
<div n="P"/>9. Scythic-like object (Yūpa)
<div n="P"/>10. Stūpa
<div n="P"/>11. Triśūla
<div n="P"/>12. Nandipada
<div n="P"/>13. Shell
<div n="P"/>14. Svastika
<div n="P"/>15. Vase or Maṅgala Kalaśa
<div n="P"/>16. Tribal sign or Ujjayinī Symbol
<div n="HI"/>17. Two {%‘s’%} with a line in between probably representing
<div n="lb"/>two hooded snakes
<div n="P"/>18. Triangular-headed symbol or more probably a Yūpa
<div n="P"/>19. Zig-Zag line depicting snake or river
<div n="P"/>20. Circles with dots around, probably representing the sun
<div n="HI"/>21. Curved object within railing, probably a representation
<div n="lb"/>of the Yūpa
<div n="P"/>22. Hill so-called Caitya
<div n="P"/>23. Six-headed Ṣaṣṭhī or Kṛttikā<sup>628</sup>
<div n="P"/>24. Śiva.

<H>CONCLUSION
<>We have discussed the following names of the tribes:
<P>1. Ābhīra
<P>2. Ārjunāyanas
<P>3. Āṭavikas
<P>4. Daivaputra
<P>5. Hūṇa
<P>6. Kākas
<P>7. Kharaparikas
<P>8. Kotas
<P>9. Kurus
<P>10. Licchavis
<P>11. Madrakas
<P>12. Mālava
<P>13. Mleccha
<P>14. Muruṇḍas
<P>15. Prārjunas
<P>16. Puṣyamitras
<P>17. Ṣāhānuṣāhi
<P>18. Ṣāhi
<P>19. Saiṃhalaka
<P>20. Śaka
<P>21. Sanakānīka
<P>22. Vāhlīka
<P>23. Yaudheya
<P>Among these the Ābhīra, Ārjunāyanas, Āṭavikas, Kākas,
<>Kharaparikas, Kotas, Kurus, Licchavis, Madrakas, Mālava,
<>Prārjunas, Puṣyamitras, Sanakānīkas and Yaudheyas are the
<>indigenous tribes while the Daivaputra, Hūṇa, Mleccha,
<>Muruṇḍas, Ṣāhānuṣāhi, Ṣāhi, Saiṃhalaka, Śaka, and Vāhlīka
<>represent the foreign stock.
<P>We have seen how some of these tribes migrated to places
<>other than their original settlements and gave their names to
[Page-177+ 39]
<>the janapadas they settled. They replaced the old Vedic tribes
<>in Punjab and Rajasthan though some of them are deemed as
<>offshoots of the main tribe. The Prārjunas, Sanakānīkas,
<>Kākas and Kharaparikas may be later tribes since they find
<>hardly any mention in the ancient texts. The Madrakas who
<>were a branch of the Śālvas (who had a totemic origin) and
<>the Licchavis who had legendary origin as a result of an
<>incestuous union between brother and sister may even be pre-
<>dated to Āryan way of life, indicating the period of totemic
<>worship and when there was no conscious taboo on incest.
<>About the foreign tribes mentioned above we find that the
<>Śakas influenced India so much that the Purāṇa-writers included
<>{%Śaka-dvīpa%} in the Bhuvanakośa section. There are probabilities
<>of the Hūṇa and Vāhlīka settlements in the Punjab and some
<>territories known after them. The title Ṣāhi was supplanted by
<>the Hūṇas and Turks in their administrative systems. After the
<>Āryans migrated to the east, the lands in the North-West were
<>looked at with contempt, by the easterners and were labelled
<>as the Mleccha lands. The term Mleccha was generally used
<>for the foreigners who did not come under the pale of Āryandom.
<>Hence the people in the North-West who came under foreign
<>influence and were liberalized in their outlook, were also
<>terms as the Mlecchas. Thus we find that the process of
<>political and the ethnic transformation continued.
<P>Not only that we find that the majority of the above-
<>mentioned tribes were Āryanized, some under the Vrātya
<>variety while others under the {%Vṛṣala%} system. The Hūṇas and
<>the Śakas were admitted to the Kṣatriya stock while the Śaka-
<>brāhmaṇas known as the Magas were brahmanised. Many pre-
<>Āryan names were Sanskritized but some names retained their
<>old forms; the names like the Licchavis, Ābhīra, etc., cannot
<>be explained through the root and suffix of Āryan language.<sup>629</sup>
<P>Thus we see that the ethnic, geographical and cultural
<>factors differentiated one tribe from the other. The use of the
<>terms Ārya, Anārya, Mleccha, Vrātya and Vṛṣala prove it
<>beyond doubt. But there was interaction among these tribes
<>and the tribes which interacted later survived as castes. Most
<>of these tribes represented the Little Tradition and were
<>absorbed into the Great Tradition. Some of their cults and their
[Page-178+ 38]
<>gods became a part of the main-stream of the Āryan society.
<P>The Linguistic Survey of India has shown a survival of
<>India's {%janapadas%} through the long periods of time. The areas
<>of Indian dialects and languages as they are found today
<>correspond, in a striking manner, to the ancient or medieval
<>{%janapadas%} or {%janapada-saṃghātas%} (federations of {%Janapadas%}).
<>Even the Janapadas of the {%mahā-Janapadas%} of the sixth century
<>B.C. comprised small areas. ‘The ancients were not great
<>conquerors’ declared Bāṇa, an author of the seventh century
<>A.D., ‘for in a small area of land, they had number of kings’.<sup>630</sup>
<>By the close of the Gupta period, however, the {%Janapadas%}
<>had grown sufficiently in size, and in the middle ages they
<>came to be almost what we find them today.<sup>631</sup>
<P>It may also be conceded that the gaṇa states of the
<>Yaudheyas, Mālavas and Licchavis were not democracies or
<>republics in the sense in which we understand these words
<>today. Supreme and ultimate power did not lie vested in the
<>whole body of adult citizens. We can still describe these states
<>as republics. Standard works and authorities on the political
<>science define republic as a state, where the sovereign power
<>vests, not in a single person as in monarchy, but in a group or
<>college of persons, more or less numerous. Oligarchies, aristo-
<>cracies, and democracies have all been labelled as republics.<sup>632</sup>
<P>In any case modern India may take legitimate pride in the
<>fact that, though she may not have had democracies in the
<>modern sense, government by discussion was by no means
<>unknown in her ancient civilization.<sup>633</sup>
<P>Finally we may say that Samudragupta did not destroy the
<>Mālavas, Ārjunayānas, the Yaudheyas and the Madras to
<>extinction; they had become tributary but retained their internal
<>autonomy. Their territories were never directly administered
<>by the Guptas, and so their republican institutions could not
<>have been much affected.

<H>Prologue
<P>“Place-names have an abiding interest: historical geographi-
<>cal, linguistic, and above all, human. They may tell us how
<>our ancestors lived, and how they looked on life. Place-names
<>may be picturesque, even poetical, or they may be pedestrian,
<>even trivial. All are worthy of observation.”<sup>1</sup>
<P>Their study needs serious scientific investigation. Every
<>available recorded form must be studied minutely and an ex-
<>tensive knowledge of many languages and dialects may be
<>required. Names of cities, castles, countries, towns, villages,
<>hamlets, roads, lanes, footpaths, mountains, hills, islands, fields,
<>forests, rivers, lakes and streams can provide us with a wealth
<>of information about local history, geography, dialects and
<>phonetic features. We should arrange the recorded forms in a
<>chronological order and study them keeping in view the similar
<>instances. We should study the place names by the following
<>process:
<P>(i) The initial terms and their significance,
<P>(ii) The suffixes and their significance,
<P>(iii) Synthesis of the above results.
<P>By such study of place-names we can peep into the cul-
<>ture of the past and compare it with the existing culture.
<P>Countries, towns, mountains and rivers are generally
<>named after discoverers, conquerors, founders and celebrated
<>men. We must also keep in view the situation of a place, its
<>surroundings and inhabitants.
<P>The study of place names has received considerable atten-
<>tion in Western countries specially in Scandinavia, England
<>and America.
<P>In England the scientific investigation of local nomencla-
<>ture began in the year 1901 when Walter William Skeat's book
<>{%The place-names of Cambridgeshire%} was published. Skeat
<>was constantly stimulated and encouraged by the erudite
<>scholar Henry Bradley. Skeat and Bradley with Sir Allen
[Page-204+ 39]
<>Mawer founded in 1923 an English Place-name Society under
<>the patronage of the British Academy. Scholars, archivists,
<>librarians, curators, teachers, students and people from other
<>professions have gladly helped in the work of the society and as
<>the country surveys have appeared year by year, notable addi-
<>tions have been made to the knowledge of local archaeology,
<>history and geography, of regional dialects, past and present.<sup>2</sup>
<P>In India<sup>3</sup>, S.K. Chatterji<sup>4</sup>, Sefti Pillar<sup>5</sup>, Krishnapada Gos-
<>wami<sup>6</sup>, Bhayani<sup>7</sup> and Sandesara<sup>8</sup> have made the studies in this
<>direction.
<P>H.D. Sankalia<sup>9</sup> classifies the place-names into the following
<>groups:
<P>I. Place-names after a person, deity, spirit or tribe.
<P>(i) Place-names after a person — -hero, saint, tribal leader
<P>(ii) Place-names after a deity
<P>(iii) Place-names after a sptrit
<P>(iv) Place-names after tribes or peoples
<P>II. Place-names after an event — auspicious occasion, bad
<>occasion.
<P>III. Place-names after customs and superstitions.
<P>IV. Place-names after geographical and physical features:
<>(i) Place-names after hills, mountains, mounds or any
<>elevated place
<P>(ii) Place-names after rivers, streams, lakes and ponds,
<P>(iii) Place-names after forests, deserts, steppes, etc.
<P>V. Place-names after animals, birds and reptiles:
<P>(i) Animals
<P>(ii) Birds
<P>(iii) Reptiles
<P>VI. Place-names after names of existing places.
<>Chatterji<sup>10</sup> would suggest the following classification:
<P>(i) Place-names from tribes or castes living there originally.
<P>(ii) Place-names from names of natural features.
<P>(iii) Place-names of a religious character.
<P>(iv) Place-names after names of persons or events.
<P>(v) Place-names copied from other place-names.
<P>Actually both the classifications mean the same thing and
<>represent the general trends of naming the places. Dr. Sankalia
<>seems to have just simplified and annotated Dr. Chatterji's
[Page-205+ 39]
<>classification.
<P>It may be pointed out that tradition, particularly as recor-
<>ded in the Epics and Purāṇas ascribes the foundation of cities
<>to particular kings, who are often believed to have given their
<>name to the respective cities but sometimes it remains in-
<>consistent with the original statements. This may indicate that
<>sometimes it was thought that cities could be founded only
<>by kings; no other factor was envisaged to be responsible for
<>the expansion of urbanism — a belief which ignores the inter-
<>play of variables that went into the making of cities.<sup>11</sup>
<P>“The analysis which Pāṇini gives of the underlying mean-
<>ings which relate place-names to human society, shows conclu-
<>sively that place-names do not originate by mere accident, but
<>are the outcome of social and historical conditions with which
<>a community is intimately connected. An etymological app-
<>roach to the place-names of a country, therefore, introduces us
<>to many a forgotten chapter of history and ethnography.”<sup>12</sup>
<P>But Pāṇini<sup>13</sup> also cautions his readers that the etymological
<>meaning of place-names should not be held authoritative since
<>the name should vanish when the people leave the place who
<>gave their name to it.
<P>Pāṇini<sup>14</sup> gives the following ending of place-names:
<P>1. Nagara (IV. 2. 142)
<P>2. Pura (IV. 2. 122)
<P>3. Grāma (IV. 2. 142)
<P>4. Kheṭa (VI 2. 126)
<P>5. Ghoṣa (VI. 2. 85)
<P>(6-9) Kūla, Sūda, Sthala, Karṣa (VI 2. 129)
<P>(10-11) Tīra, Rūpya (VI. 1. 135)
<P>(12-15) Kaccha, Agni, Vaktra, Garta (VI. 2. 126)
<P>(16) Palada (IV. 2. 142)
<P>(17) Arma (VI. 2. 90)
<P>(18) Vaha (IV. 2. 122)
<P>(19) Hrada (IV. 2. 142)
<P>(20) Prastha (IV. 2. 122, IV. 2. 110)
<P>(21) Kanthā (IV. 2. 142)
<P>Pāṇini gives the interesting information that the ending
<>kanthā was in use in Uśīnara (11. 4.20) and Varṇu (Bannu)
<>(IV. 2.103). Kanthā was a Śaka word for a town as in expression
[Page-206+ 39]
<>Kandāvara-Kanthāvara occurring in a Kharoṣṭhī inscription.<sup>15</sup>
<P>There are also instances when place-names have been very
<>lengthy.<sup>16</sup>
<P>1. The longest place-name in Great Britain has 58 letters —
<>Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogercychwyrndrobw Hllantsysiliogo-
<>gogoch — a railway station on the Holyhead-Euston
<>line.<sup>17</sup>
<P>2. Kardivilliwarrakurrakurrieapparlarndoo<sup>18</sup> —
<>This is not a misprint. It is an Australian aboriginal
<>word. It is the name of a lake in the Northern territory,
<>and it means ‘the stralight shining on the waters of the
<>lake’.<sup>19</sup>
<P>Modern place-names suffixes and prefixes may be divided
<>into three main categories.
<HI>(i) Endings with Sanskrit influence — Pura, Purā, Nagara,
<>Koṭa, Thala (Sthala), Kuṇḍa, Pokhrā, Pāḍā, Bāḍī, etc.
<HI>(ii) Endings with Persian-Arabic influence: — Tālāba, Gañja,
<>(Nawabganj, Daraganja, Vishveshwaraganja), Chaka.
<HI>(iii) Vernacular terms added before: Ḍerā, Mohalla,
<>Basti, etc.
<HI>(iv) English-Colony, town, street, Road, Fountain, Sector,
<>Block, Enclave, Gate, Bridge, Place and Cantt. (Can-
<>tonment).
<P>According to the Mahābhārata<sup>20</sup>, ‘a place must be named
<>after any of its peculiar features’.
<P>In the Mahābhārata<sup>21</sup> {%‘Janapada’ ‘Deśa’%} and {%Rāṣṭra%} are used
<>synonymously.<sup>22</sup> Yet in practice, they must differ slightly.
<>‘Deśa’ means ‘a country’, province or any patch of land’, ‘Jana-
<>pada’, a tribal settlement,<sup>23</sup> whereas ‘Rāṣṭra’ is definitely a
<>political term, denoting ‘whatever fell under the jurisdiction
<>of the sovereignty’.
<P>It will be interesting to note the antiquity of place-name
<>terms. We find Rāṣṭra<sup>24</sup> as the oldest right from the Ṛgveda,
<>and used for the biggest unit. Its equivalent Janapada came
<>into being in the Brāhmaṇa-period.<sup>25</sup> The Ṛgveda frequently
<>refers to tribes viz. the Yadus, the Purus, the Anus etc. who
<>were residing in particular area without mentioning their terri-
<>tory, province or kingdom.<sup>26</sup> The ordinary people of a Jana-
<>pada were called {%Viś%} which were divided into {%grāmas%} or unions
[Page-207+ 37]
<>of many families. So whenever the people of {%grāmas%} settled they
<>were termed as {%grāmas%} (villages) and hence the word {%Saṃgrāma%}
<>came into being when a number of {%grāmas%} united for a battle.
<>Every Janapada had a {%pura%} or chief city (capital) where the
<>king resided. Every Janapada was politically named as Rāṣṭra.<sup>27</sup>
<>Pāṇini mentions a number of Janapadas in the Aṣṭādhyāyī.<sup>28</sup>
<>Kauṭilya also uses the term Janapada for territory as the con-
<>stituent of State.<sup>29</sup> We find the mention of sixteen Mahājanapadas
<>of Āryāvarta in many places in the Buddhist literature. The
<>term {%‘rājya’%} with its different kinds is referred to in the later
<>Vedic period i. e. in the Brāhmaṇas.
<P>Later on we find that the connotations of the territorial
<>units differed from place to place and time to time. Pāṇini men-
<>tions separately the villages and towns of Eastern India ({%Prācām%}
<>{%grāmanagarāṇām,%} VII. 3. 14), but with reference to Vāhīka and
<>Udīcya country he uses the term grāma in a generic sense to
<>include all centres of population (IV. 2. 117 and IV. 2. 109).
<>Patañjali in commenting on the distinctions between the terms
<>{%grāma%} and {%pura%} remarks that these should not be settled by rules
<>of grammar but by local usage ({%tatrātinirbandho na lābhaḥ,%}
<>III. 321).
<P>The two terms {%grāma%} and {%nagara%} were used indiscriminately
<>in the Vāhīka country (Punjab) where the villages had also
<>grown in prosperity like the towns, and hence the word grāma
<>here included nagara also in the connotation.<sup>30</sup>
<P>Yajñavalkya<sup>31</sup> uses the term {%Pūga%} which the Mitākṣarā
<>explains as the assembly of the inhabitants of the same place
<>with different castes and occupations such as village, city etc.
<P>The {%Amarakośa%} gives the following words as synonymous,
<>all standing for town or city: {%pur, purī, nagarī, pattana, puṭa-%}
<>{%bhedana, sthānīya%} and {%nigama.%}<sup>32</sup> It also differentiates the
<>{%Mūlanagara%} (main city) from the {%Sākhā-nagara%} (branch
<>town).<sup>33</sup>

 {%Rāṣṭra<sup>1</sup>%}¦ (from §rāj):
<div n="P"/>It is the oldest and biggest territorial term. In the Ṛgveda<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and later Saṃhitās,<sup>3</sup> it denotes ‘kingdom’ or ‘royal territory’.
<div n="lb"/>It is considered to be one of the Prakṛtis (constituents)<sup>4</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>refers to a country.<sup>5</sup> It was the name of a Commissioner's
<div n="lb"/>division under the Rāṣṭrakūṭas.<sup>6</sup> In South India, under the
<div n="lb"/>Pallavas, Kadambas, and Sālaṅkāyanas also it denotes only
<div n="lb"/>a district, if not a tehsil.<sup>7</sup> The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra<sup>8</sup> says
<div n="lb"/>that ‘all the rāṣṭra including {%nagara%} is called {%deśa%} or {%maṇḍala%}
<div n="lb"/>while nagara is excluded in janapada’.
<div n="P"/>It divides rāṣṭras into three kinds: —
<div n="P"/>(i) Big: It consists of nine thousand and ninety villages,
<div n="lb"/>but some scholars say that the nine thousand and sixty
<div n="lb"/>four villages make a big rāṣṭra.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>(ii) Middle: It consists of five thousand, three hundred and
<div n="lb"/>eighty four villages.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>(iii) Small: It consists of one thousand, five hundred and
<div n="lb"/>forty eight villages.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>It further discusses that seven cities should be established
<div n="lb"/>in each rāṣṭra.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>In place-names rāṣṭra is changed into:<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>(a) Rāṭhā, as Mahārāṣṭra, Marāṭhā
<div n="P"/>(b) Rāṭ, at Mayarāṣṭra, (= Mayarāṭ), Mirāṭ
<div n="P"/>It also changes into raṭṭa,
<div n="P"/>Cf. Nāgiraṭṭa. Walde also derives it
<div n="lb"/>from §rāj-(n. sg. rāṭ)
<div n="P"/>Sk. {%rāṣṭra:%} AV. {%rāstar — ,<sup>14</sup>%}
[Page-210+ 39]
<div n="P"/>In ancient Indian history extending over several centuries,
<div n="lb"/>we do not find uniformity in the nomenclature of the different
<div n="lb"/>territorial and administrative divisions in the various kingdoms
<div n="lb"/>flourishing in different centuries and provinces. In the small
<div n="lb"/>kingdoms like those of the Pallavas, the Vākāṭakas and
<div n="lb"/>Gāhaḍavālas we usually find reference to only one territorial
<div n="lb"/>division, the district variously called {%viṣaya%} or {%rāṣṭra.<sup>15</sup>%}
<div n="P"/>Following are the names with this ending:

<L>340<pc>210<k1>devarAzwra<k2>devarAzwra
1. {%Devarāṣṭra%}¦ (No. 1, L. 20):
<div n="P"/>It has been mentioned as ruled by Kubera one of the kings
<div n="lb"/>ruling in Southern Region who were subdued by Samudragupta.
<div n="lb"/>Dey<sup>16</sup> identifies it with the Maratha country (i. e. Mahārāṣṭra).
<div n="lb"/>Fleet and Smith are also of the same opinion. G. Ramdas
<div n="lb"/>slightly differs from them when he identifies Devarāṣṭra with
<div n="lb"/>modern Devagiri in the Dharwar district.<sup>17</sup> According to R.D.
<div n="lb"/>Banerjee<sup>18</sup> Devarāṣṭra is the name of a district or province in
<div n="lb"/>Kaliṅga. B.C. Law<sup>19</sup> identifies it with Yellowmanchili taluka of
<div n="lb"/>the Vizagapatam district, which is also the view of H.C. Ray-
<div n="lb"/>chaudhuri,<sup>20</sup> S.B. Chaudhuri,<sup>21</sup> Dubreuil and Bhandarkar.<sup>22</sup> This
<div n="lb"/>view is generally accepted at present. Earlier scholars held that
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta made a round of the South crossing from the
<div n="lb"/>eastern to the western coast of India. But this involves serious
<div n="lb"/>difficulties about his potential relations with the Vākāṭakas.
<div n="lb"/>Now, scholars describe southern campaign of Samudragupta
<div n="lb"/>as confined to the eastern coast. Thus it becomes apparent
<div n="lb"/>that Devarāṣṭra was conterminous with Kośala (Sirpur). Tām-
<div n="lb"/>ralipti may have been included in Devarāṣṭra.<sup>23</sup>
<div n="P"/>2. Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa (No 28, L. 2, L. 8, L. 15):
<div n="P"/>L. 2 of the inscription mentions a maṇḍala (sub-division) called
<div n="lb"/>Nāgiraṭṭa (Nāgiraṭṭa-māṇḍalika) and later on refers to Mūla-
<div n="lb"/>Nāgiraṭṭa which seems to have been the headquarters of this
<div n="lb"/>maṇḍala. It is clear from the inscription itself that Mūla-
<div n="lb"/>Nāgiraṭṭa was situated in the neighbourhood of Nitva-Gohālī.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa literally means ‘Nāgiraṭṭa Proper’. The
<div n="lb"/>word Nāgiraṭṭa is the Prakritic form of Nāgarāṣṭra meaning ‘a
<div n="lb"/>country of the Nāgas’.

3. {%Surāṣṭra%}¦ (No. 14, L. 8, L. 9):
<div n="lb"/>In L. 8 Surāṣṭra is used in plural<sup>25</sup> while in L. 9 it is an adjective
<div n="lb"/>of {%avani%} (land).<sup>26</sup> In this inscription great importance has been
[Page-211+ 37]
<div n="lb"/>attached to Surāṣṭra. After his conquests, Skandagupta
<div n="lb"/>deliberated for days and nights together as to whom should be
<div n="lb"/>entrusted important task of guarding the land of the Surāṣṭras.<sup>27</sup>
<div n="lb"/>At last he was satisfied by appointing Parṇadatta as a governor
<div n="lb"/>over this western<sup>28</sup> region.
<div n="P"/>Surāṣṭra corresponds with Southern Kathiawar with its
<div n="lb"/>Prakrit name Soraṭh.<sup>29</sup> Literally the name means a good
<div n="lb"/>country. It was so named probably on account of the natural
<div n="lb"/>fertility of the land, Soraṭh is well known for rich crops of all
<div n="lb"/>kinds, and splendid cattle.<sup>30</sup>
<div n="P"/>Surāṣṭra<sup>31</sup> is mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription
<div n="lb"/>of Rudradāman I (A.D. 150). It was governed by Puṣyagupta,
<div n="lb"/>under Candragupta Maurya and by a Yavana Tuṣāspa under
<div n="lb"/>Aśoka.<sup>32</sup> The Purāṇas<sup>33</sup> and the Kāvyamīmāṃsā<sup>34</sup> mention it
<div n="lb"/>a country in the west while the Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>35</sup> mentions it
<div n="lb"/>as a country in the South. It may be due to the different
<div n="lb"/>geographical units made by the authors of the Kāvyamīmāṃsā
<div n="lb"/>and the Bṛhatsaṃhitā.
<div n="P"/>Under Gupta emperors Bāmanasthalī (modern Banthali) was
<div n="lb"/>the capital of Surāṣṭra, before Valabhī became its capital.<sup>36</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The name Surāṣṭra also occurs in the Mahābhārata, the
<div n="lb"/>Jātakas<sup>37</sup>, and several times in the Rāmāyaṇa.<sup>38</sup> It is also
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya.<sup>39</sup> In Kauṭilya's Arthaśās-
<div n="lb"/>tra, Surāṣṭras are mentioned as one of the corporations of
<div n="lb"/>warriors who lived by agriculture and trade.<sup>40</sup> According to
<div n="lb"/>the Arthaśāstra the elephants of Surāṣṭra were inferior to those
<div n="lb"/>belonging to Aṅga and Kaliṅga.<sup>41</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the medieval period,<sup>42</sup> in three directions, Bhavanagar,
<div n="lb"/>Porabandar and Somanath (the famous temple) were the limits
<div n="lb"/>of Surāṣṭra.

 {%Bhukti%}¦ (from §bhuj)
<div n="P"/>Literally it means ‘enjoyment’ or possession.<sup>43</sup> Bhukti
<div n="lb"/>denoted an administrative division smaller than a modern
<div n="lb"/>Tehsil or Taluka in the Deccan and M.P., but in Northern
<div n="lb"/>India under the Guptas and Pratihāras it denoted a unit as
<div n="lb"/>large as the Commissioner's Division in modern times.<sup>44</sup> Thus
[Page-212+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Pratiṣṭhānabhukti consisted of only 12 and Koppārakabhukti
<div n="lb"/>of 50 villages in the Deccan under the Rāṣṭrakūṭas,<sup>45</sup> whereas
<div n="lb"/>under the Guptas the Puṇḍravardhanabhukti comprised of the
<div n="lb"/>districts of Dinajpur, Bogra and Rajshahi, and Magadhabhukti
<div n="lb"/>included the districts of Gayā and Pāṭaliputra.<sup>46</sup> Śrāvastibhukti
<div n="lb"/>under the Pratihāras included several districts in northern
<div n="lb"/>U.P.<sup>47</sup> The Bhuktis under the Pratihāra empire appear to have
<div n="lb"/>been rather Commissioners' Divisions than provinces.<sup>48</sup> Bhukti
<div n="lb"/>is changed into huti as Jejakabhukti, Jejahuti.<sup>49</sup> The unit bhukti
<div n="lb"/>which so often appears in the inscriptions of the Gupta period
<div n="lb"/>as the designation of an administrative unit is not frequently
<div n="lb"/>found in the early medieval period.<sup>50</sup> The mention of a
<div n="lb"/>Nagara-bhukti is also made in Deo-Baranark Inscription of
<div n="lb"/>Jīvitagupta II.<sup>51</sup>
<div n="P"/>We find only one place name with the suffix {%bhukti%} which
<div n="lb"/>is detailed below:
<div n="P"/>{%Puṇḍravardhana%} (No. 28, L. 1; No. 33, LL. 1-2; No. 34,
<div n="lb"/>L. 2; No. 35, L. 2; No. 36, L. 2; No. 37, L. 2; No. 43,
<div n="lb"/>L. 14):
<div n="P"/>This bhukti is mentioned in the Gupta epigraphs ranging
<div n="lb"/>from the years 124 to 224 of the Gupta era, i. e. from A.D. 443
<div n="lb"/>to 543. It formed an integral part of Gupta empire during this
<div n="lb"/>period. According to Inscription No. 37, a noble man (kula-
<div n="lb"/>putra) Amṛtadeva by name belonging to Ayodhyā approached
<div n="lb"/>the local government of Koṭivarṣa of which Svyambhudeva
<div n="lb"/>was the governor, under the provincial government of Puṇḍra-
<div n="lb"/>vardhana-bhukti, during the reign of Bhānugupta, and prayed
<div n="lb"/>that he might be given, by means of a copper-plate document
<div n="lb"/>in accordance with the prevailing custom, some rent-free
<div n="lb"/>waste lands. His prayer was granted.
<div n="P"/>General Cunningham<sup>52</sup> identifies Puṇḍravardhana with the
<div n="lb"/>extensive ruins known as ‘Mahāsthāngarh’, 8 miles north of
<div n="lb"/>the town of Bogra. The river Karatoyā was the dividing line
<div n="lb"/>between Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti and Kāmarūpa.<sup>53</sup> According
<div n="lb"/>to Wilson, the ancient kingdom of Puṇḍradeśa included the
<div n="lb"/>districts of Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Malda, Bogra and
<div n="lb"/>Tirhut.<sup>54</sup> It seems to have been the biggest administrative
<div n="lb"/>division or province of the Gupta empire, divided into several
<div n="lb"/>viṣayas and maṇḍalas of which twenty-four<sup>55</sup> are mentioned
[Page-213+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>in known epigraphs. In short Puṇḍravardhana signified North
<div n="lb"/>Bengal.
<div n="P"/>Puṇḍravardhana, as the name suggests, was a settlement of
<div n="lb"/>the Puṇḍras.<sup>56</sup> The first reference to the Puṇḍras is found in
<div n="lb"/>the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>57</sup> The earliest literary reference to
<div n="lb"/>Puṇḍravardhana is to be traced in the Buddhist work, the
<div n="lb"/>Divyāvadāna, where it is mentioned as the easternmost city of
<div n="lb"/>India.<sup>58</sup> The Pauṇḍra country is mentioned also in the Bṛhat-
<div n="lb"/>saṃhitā,<sup>59</sup> as situated in the east.<sup>60</sup> The Kāvyamīṃāṃsā also
<div n="lb"/>mentions it as a Janapada in the east. In the inscriptions of
<div n="lb"/>Bengal the name Puṇḍravardhana was changed into Pauṇḍra-
<div n="lb"/>vardhana in the early part of the 12th century, when it occurs
<div n="lb"/>first in the Manahali grant of Madanapāla and remained in use
<div n="lb"/>till the end of the Sena rule. The Rājataraṅgiṇī mentions
<div n="lb"/>Puṇḍravardhana as the capital of Gauḍa which is also proved
<div n="lb"/>by a reference in Puruṣottama's lexicon (11th century A.D.)<sup>61</sup>
<div n="P"/>The city lost its importance from the third quarter of the
<div n="lb"/>12th century A.D. as the later Sena kings shifted their capital
<div n="lb"/>to Gauḍa in the Malda district. Towards the end of the 13th
<div n="lb"/>or the beginning of the 14th century A.D. Puṇḍravardhana was
<div n="lb"/>occupied by the Muhammedans.<sup>62</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Place-names ending in Viṣaya%}

<L>343<pc>213<k1>vizaya<k2>vizaya
 {%Viṣaya%}¦
<div n="lb"/>According to Monier Williams it means a dominion, king-
<div n="lb"/>dom, territory, region, district, country, or abode and in plural
<div n="lb"/>it meant lands or possessions.<sup>63</sup> In the Aṣṭādhyāyī<sup>64</sup> it denotes
<div n="lb"/>regions or provinces, called after their inhabitants, e. g. Śaiba,
<div n="lb"/>the region of the Śibis; Mālavaka, the region of the Mālava
<div n="lb"/>people; Rājanyaka, of the Rājanya tribe and so forth. ‘The
<div n="lb"/>names according to Viṣaya seem to be based on the ethnic
<div n="lb"/>distribution of population over particular areas for the time
<div n="lb"/>being without reference to the form of government’.<sup>65</sup>
<div n="P"/>The word Viṣaya in the sūtra Viṣayo deśe<sup>66</sup> is significant.
<div n="lb"/>Jainendra, Śākaṭāyana and Hemacandra take it as rāṣṭra, and
<div n="lb"/>Vardhamāna as Janapada. The Kāśikā takes it as grāma-samu-
<div n="lb"/>dāya. Kātayāyana and Patañjali interpret Viṣaya as being
<div n="lb"/>identical with janapada in some cases, but their comments
<div n="lb"/>give the impression that even such geographical units as were
[Page-214+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>not a janapada were called Viṣaya.<sup>67</sup>
<div n="P"/>If Viṣaya and Janapada had been identical, Pāṇini would
<div n="lb"/>not have treated the former under a separate heading.<sup>68</sup> A
<div n="lb"/>Viṣaya denoted both a bigger unit having the status of a
<div n="lb"/>Janapada, and a smaller area which was but an estate. In the
<div n="lb"/>Rājanyādi gaṇa, viṣaya denotes janapadas, while in the
<div n="lb"/>Bhauriki and Aiṣukāri gaṇas,<sup>69</sup> it is landed property, the share
<div n="lb"/>of estate which was the source of livelihood.
<div n="P"/>In the post-pāṇinian period, distinction between Janapada
<div n="lb"/>and viṣaya was lost, both being called by the same names, for
<div n="lb"/>example Aṅgāḥ, Vangāḥ, Sumhāḥ, and Puṇḍrāḥ. In some Jana-
<div n="lb"/>padas like Rājanya, the distinction was retained, as Rājanyaka
<div n="lb"/>denoted a viṣaya and Rājanyāḥ, the Janapada of the Rājanya
<div n="lb"/>tribe. Similarly we have Vāsātaḥ, Vāsātayaḥ; Gandhāraḥ,
<div n="lb"/>Gāndhārayaḥ; and Śaibaḥ, Śibiyaḥ. Other smaller units were
<div n="lb"/>only viṣayas or estates like Bailvavanaka, Ātmakāmeyaka,
<div n="lb"/>Bhaurikavidha and Aiṣukāri-bhakta.<sup>70</sup>
<div n="P"/>The viṣaya usually corresponded with the district of the
<div n="lb"/>modern administration.<sup>71</sup> Minor bhuktis, maṇḍalas and the
<div n="lb"/>viṣayas were used to denote the same administrative division
<div n="lb"/>in many cases.<sup>72</sup> The district administration was well organised
<div n="lb"/>in the Gupta period. Some of the land-grant charters bear the
<div n="lb"/>seals of the district administration.<sup>73</sup> Sealings of the district
<div n="lb"/>administration of Rājagṛha and Gayā have been found at
<div n="lb"/>Nālandā, showing that their correspondence to outsiders bore
<div n="lb"/>the impress of their official seals.<sup>74</sup>
<div n="P"/>We have the following place-names ending in Viṣaya:
<LEND>

<L>344<pc>214<k1>gayA<k2>gayA
1. {%Gayā%}¦ (No. 21, L. 7):
<div n="P"/>A village named Revatikā belonging to the Gayā viṣaya
<div n="lb"/>was granted as an agrahāra to a brāhmaṇa, ostensibly by
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta.<sup>75</sup> Gayā is at present headquarters of the
<div n="lb"/>Gayā district, 60 miles due south of Patna. It comprises the
<div n="lb"/>modern town of Sahebganj on the northern side and the
<div n="lb"/>ancient town of Gayā on the southern side.<sup>76</sup> Much has been
<div n="lb"/>written on Gayā,<sup>77</sup> all of which is not possible to discuss
<div n="lb"/>here. We will confine ourselves to the origin of the name Gayā
<div n="lb"/>and the importance of Gayā.
<div n="P"/>In the Ṛgveda Gaya is a proper name applied to a com-
<div n="lb"/>poser of hymns.<sup>78</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>79</sup> Gaya appears to be a
[Page-215+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>wonder-worder or sorcerer along with Asita and Kaśyapa who
<div n="lb"/>later on transformed himself into Gayāsura.<sup>80</sup> According to
<div n="lb"/>the Vāyu Purāṇa,<sup>81</sup> the city was named Gaya after an Asura,
<div n="lb"/>Gaya by name (Gayāsura). Viṣṇu killed this demon but
<div n="lb"/>granted him a boon that this city would be held highly sacred.
<div n="lb"/>According to R.L. Mitra,<sup>82</sup> this story is an allegorical repre-
<div n="lb"/>sentation of the expulsion of Buddhism from Gayā which
<div n="lb"/>was the headquarters of the Buddhist faith. Aurṇavābha in ex-
<div n="lb"/>plaining ‘idam Viṣṇur-vī Cakrame tredhā nidadhe padam’<sup>83</sup>
<div n="lb"/>in the Nirukta<sup>84</sup> holds that the three steps of Viṣṇu were placed
<div n="lb"/>on Samārohaṇa, Viṣṇupada and Gayaśiras. The Māhabhārata
<div n="lb"/>(III. 95 and VII. 64) describes the performance of sacrifices by
<div n="lb"/>Gaya<sup>85</sup> references to which<sup>86</sup> are also found in the Rāmā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇa,<sup>87</sup> Bhāgavata Purāṇa<sup>88</sup> Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,<sup>89</sup> Agni
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇa,<sup>90</sup> Viṣṇu Purāṇa,<sup>91</sup> Vāmana Purāṇa,<sup>92</sup> etc. Aśvaghoṣa's
<div n="lb"/>Buddhacarita<sup>93</sup> (I or II cent. A.D.) speaks of the Buddha's
<div n="lb"/>visit to the hermitage called ‘the city of the royal sage Gaya’,
<div n="lb"/>who was later conceived as a great giant.<sup>94</sup>
<div n="P"/>We can find evidence of the importance of Gayā growing
<div n="lb"/>in the period subsequent to A.D. 750. At Gayā while we have
<div n="lb"/>only one inscription belonging to the Gupta period, we get
<div n="lb"/>numerous inscriptions belonging to the Pāla period.<sup>95</sup> But
<div n="lb"/>these records are of not much use for the history of the town,
<div n="lb"/>they simply show that till the end of the twelfth century A.D.
<div n="lb"/>it was under the Pālas.<sup>96</sup>
<div n="P"/>The city played no major role in polities at any period of
<div n="lb"/>history but it was certainly a centre of religious movements of
<div n="lb"/>Buddhist and the Brahmanical Hindus.<sup>97</sup> Gayā which was the
<div n="lb"/>headquarters of Buddhist faith passed to the Hindus between
<div n="lb"/>the second and fourth centuries of the Christian era and by
<div n="lb"/>A.D. 637 when Hiuen Tsang visited the city it had become a
<div n="lb"/>thriving centre of Hindu Brahmanical religion.<sup>98</sup>
<div n="P"/>The religious importance of Gayā is met with in the Māhā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata,<sup>99</sup> Rāmāyaṇa<sup>100</sup> and Purāṇas.<sup>101</sup> The Gayā has a
<div n="lb"/>special religious importance with reference to the Śrāddha cere-
<div n="lb"/>mony.<sup>102</sup>

<div n="lb"/>It has been described as a viṣaya under Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti.
<div n="lb"/>This reference clearly shows that the size of a viṣaya was small-

<div n="lb"/>seems to have comprised the southern part of the Dinajpur

<div n="lb"/>the eastern tracts of the Bogra district.<sup>108</sup> Its head-quarters was
<div n="lb"/>Diw-kot (Devakoṭa or Devīkoṭa).<sup>109</sup> Yādavaprakāśa identifies
<div n="lb"/>Koṭivarṣa with Devīkoṭṭa.<sup>110</sup> The Vāyu Purāṇa also refers to a
<div n="lb"/>city of the name of Koṭivarṣa.<sup>111</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Prakrit lexicon Pāia-sadda-mahaṇṇavo describes it as
<div n="lb"/>the capital of Lāṭa country.<sup>112</sup> The name is known to the Jain
<div n="lb"/>Prajñāpanā in which it is placed in Lāḍha or Lāṭa.<sup>113</sup>
<div n="P"/>Hemacandra<sup>114</sup> says that Koṭivarṣa, Bāṇapura, Devīkoṭa,
<div n="lb"/>Umāvana and Śoṇitapura are identical. Puruṣottama<sup>115</sup> agrees
<div n="lb"/>with Hemacandra with the only difference that he mentions
<div n="lb"/>Uṣāvana in place of Umāvana. Bāṇapura is represented by
<div n="lb"/>Bāngarh in the Dinajpur district, which still preserves the exten-
<div n="lb"/>sive ruins of a citadel known as Damdamaḥ said to have been
<div n="lb"/>the fort of Devīkoṭa associated with the exploits of the mythi-
<div n="lb"/>cal king Bāṇa.<sup>116</sup> Diw-koṭa or Devīkoṭa (wrongly read as Dihi-

<div n="lb"/>Lakhnautī (Lakṣaṇavatī).<sup>117</sup>
<div n="P"/>The termination varṣa is significant. It denotes a division
<div n="lb"/>of the earth as separated off by mountain ranges.<sup>118</sup> From the
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas we know of such names as Harivarṣa, Kiṃpuruṣa-
<div n="lb"/>Varṣa and Bhārata-Varṣa.<sup>119</sup> Varṣam in Pāṇini<sup>120</sup> means the
<div n="lb"/>rainy season. We know that rains are connected with the moun-
<div n="lb"/>tains. So originally the divisions might have been made accord-
<div n="lb"/>ing to the rains in different areas. Rains being very important
<div n="lb"/>for agriculture affect the inhabitants of a certain area through-
<div n="lb"/>out the year. Later on the semantic development of the word
<div n="lb"/>came to denote a year. In India the seasons have been regard-
<div n="lb"/>ed to be important and hence they had often been used to
[Page-217+ 40]
<div n="lb"/>denote the year.<sup>121</sup>

<div n="lb"/>The Viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā also spelt as Krimilā is mention-
<div n="lb"/>ed in inscription No. 40. According to D.C. Sircar “as the
<div n="lb"/>charter is spurious and seems to have been forged a few centu-
<div n="lb"/>ries after Samudragupta's time, it may or may not prove the
<div n="lb"/>existence of a viṣaya and therefore of a city of the above name
<div n="lb"/>in the fourth century.<sup>122</sup> But certain old seals found at Nālandā
<div n="lb"/>prove the existence of Kṛmilā before the Pāla occupation of
<div n="lb"/>Bihar.<sup>123</sup> The village Kavāla in the Krimilāviṣaya known from
<div n="lb"/>one such seal can be identified with modern Kawāli not far
<div n="lb"/>from Valgūdar.<sup>124</sup> The viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā is also men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned in the records of the Pālas of Bengal and Bihar.<sup>125</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to a tradition recorded in the Harivaṃśa,<sup>126</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Vayu Purāṇa<sup>127</sup> and the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa<sup>128</sup> Kṛmi, the son
<div n="lb"/>of king Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty, born of his second queen
<div n="lb"/>Kṛmi, was the lord of Kṛmilāpurī.<sup>129</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Buddhist literature, we get various forms for the city
<div n="lb"/>of Kṛmilā: Kimilā, Kimmilā and Kimbilā. The name of an
<div n="lb"/>inhabitant of the city is given as Kimila, Kimmilā or Kimbilā.
<div n="lb"/>Malālasekera<sup>130</sup> recognises the spellings Kimilā or Kimbilā and
<div n="lb"/>Kimila or Kimbila, but prefers the forms Kimbilā and Kimbilā.
<div n="lb"/>Kimilā can be the Pali form of Sanskrit Kṛmilā (or Krimilā),
<div n="lb"/>and Kimmilā can be derived from the other Sanskrit variant
<div n="lb"/>Kirmilā.<sup>131</sup> Two Suttas, the Kimilāsutta and Kimilasutta, were
<div n="lb"/>preached by the Buddha when he was camping at the city of
<div n="lb"/>Kimilā (Kṛmilā) said to have been situated on the bank of the
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā. The river is now at a short distance from the villages
<div n="lb"/>of Valgūdar and Rajauna, on the site of which the ancient city
<div n="lb"/>stood.<sup>132</sup>
<div n="P"/>M.S. Pandey<sup>133</sup> opposes the identification of Kṛmilā with
<div n="lb"/>Valgūdar on the ground that there is not sufficient evidence
<div n="lb"/>to prove this identification. Though Kṛmilā is not referred to
<div n="lb"/>in early Pali literature, we find a city named Kṛmilā mention-
<div n="lb"/>ed in the Aṅguttara Nikāya Commentary.<sup>134</sup> According to this
<div n="lb"/>commentary, the city stood on the bank of the Gaṅgā. But
<div n="lb"/>now-a-days, the Gaṅgā flows at some distance from this region
<div n="lb"/>which may be due to a change in the course of the river dur-
<div n="lb"/>ing so many centuries. The city was not very important and
<div n="lb"/>may have gradually disappeared. At present we do not find
[Page-218+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>any traces of the city: it may have been washed away by the
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā. According to Pandey<sup>135</sup> the name of the modern villa-
<div n="lb"/>ge Kiul has some resemblance with the name Kṛmilā and it is
<div n="lb"/>not unlikely that the city may have been somewhere in that
<div n="lb"/>locality.
<div n="P"/>Sircar is himself not sure about the identification of Kṛmilā
<div n="lb"/>with Valgūdar<sup>136</sup> and seems to prefer the claim of modern
<div n="lb"/>Kawali not being far from Valgūdar Kṛmilā.<sup>137</sup> But in the
<div n="lb"/>district Gazetteer of Monghyr it is the village of Kiul which
<div n="lb"/>is mentioned and not Kawali. Hence we prefer the view of
<div n="lb"/>Dr. Pandey.
<div n="P"/>The word Kṛmilā means “a fruitful woman” or “a place
<div n="lb"/>full of worms” and the word Kṛmi forming its first part is
<div n="lb"/>sometimes also written as Krimi.<sup>138</sup>

<div n="lb"/>with vihāras, (and) the mountains of which are covered over

<div n="P"/>The country south of Mahī or at times south of the Nar-

<div n="lb"/>rised the collectorates of Surat, Bharoch, Kheda and parts of
<div n="lb"/>Baroda territory.<sup>141</sup>

<div n="lb"/>Broach.<sup>142</sup> Lāṭa has been identified with Central and Southern

<div n="lb"/>Gujarat, the capital city of which is stated in the Dīpavaṃśa to
<div n="lb"/>have been Siṃapura (Sīhapura).<sup>146</sup> In the early days of the
<div n="lb"/>imperial Guptas, the Lāṭa country was formed into an admini-
<div n="lb"/>strative province in the Lāṭaviṣaya.<sup>147</sup> The Śaktisaṅgam Tantra
<div n="lb"/>places the Lāṭa country to the west of Avanti and to the north-
<div n="lb"/>west of Vidarbha.<sup>148</sup>
<div n="P"/>Lāṭa is the same as the Larike of Ptolemy which lay to the

<div n="lb"/>The term could also be used for the territory under the posse-

<div n="lb"/>for some kind of administrative division though in early medie-

 {%Airikiṇa%}¦ (No. 2, L. 25):
<div n="lb"/>It has been described here as the bhoga-nagara of the king (sva-
<div n="lb"/>bhoga-nagara).<sup>164</sup> In this context the use of the phrase ‘Sva-
<div n="lb"/>bhoganagara’ is important. K.P. Jayaswal<sup>165</sup> interprets ‘sva bho-
<div n="lb"/>ganagara’ as a town that had, since the victory scored by the
<div n="lb"/>Gupta king at Eraṇ, become his direct personal possession.
<div n="lb"/>Fleet translates it as ‘the city of his own enjoyment’.<sup>166</sup>
<div n="P"/>Daśaratha Sharma<sup>167</sup> explains it as analogous to the word
<div n="lb"/>‘Ekabhoga’ defined in the Mānasāra as a town or village inha-
<div n="lb"/>bited by a single land-holder along with his dependants.<sup>168</sup> It
<div n="lb"/>is ‘Svabhoga’ for the master and ‘Ekabhoga’ for others’. Sharma
<div n="lb"/>connects this ‘Svabhoga’ with a feudatory ‘who lived therein
<div n="lb"/>with his family and dependants, and on whom Samudragupta,
<div n="lb"/>pleased by his ‘devotion’, policy, and valour’ conferred the litle
<div n="lb"/>of Rājan and the accompanying glories of consecration, etc.
<div n="lb"/>described in verse 4.<sup>169</sup> But Sharma seems to be incorrect in
<div n="lb"/>associating the inscription with a feudatory, the inscription
<div n="lb"/>belongs to Samudragupta himself which is clear by further
<div n="lb"/>description in subsequent verses.<sup>170</sup> No doubt in the Eraṇ
<div n="lb"/>Stone Boar Inscription of Toramāṇa<sup>171</sup> the word ‘sva-viṣaya’
<div n="lb"/>an adjectival clause of Airikiṇa is used to refer to a feudatory,
<div n="lb"/>which is very clear from the inscription.
<div n="P"/>The editor<sup>172</sup> also, following Sharma, is misled and ex-
<div n="lb"/>plains the term ‘Svabhoga’ as implying a grant, or something
<div n="lb"/>like it by the governor of the province, who had for his own
<div n="lb"/>salary the revenues of the city of Airikiṇa allotted to him.<sup>173</sup>
<div n="lb"/>But the term ‘Svabhoganagara’ is significant in connoting royal
<div n="lb"/>status, higher than that of a feudatory chief and can mean
<div n="lb"/>‘the capital city’ where the king himself was residing. In con-
<div n="lb"/>trast, in the Earṇ Stone Boar Inscription of Toramāṇa<sup>174</sup> the
[Page-221+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>term ‘Sva-viṣaya’ has been used for the feudatory Dhanyaviṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>(of king Toramāṇa) who may have been a viṣayapati, the ad-
<div n="lb"/>ministrator-incharge of Eraṇ.
<div n="P"/>Airikiṇa is the same as modern Eraṇ, the ancient Airikiṇa,
<div n="lb"/>a village on the left bank of the Bina, in Sagar District of
<div n="lb"/>Madhya Pradesh. From the Copper Coins of the Aśokan
<div n="lb"/>period found at Eraṇ, we get an earlier Pali or Prakrit form
<div n="lb"/>of the name which is Erakaña or Erakana or Erakaṇa.<sup>175</sup> It
<div n="lb"/>is thus clear that Erakaña or Erakaṇa is the simplified form of
<div n="lb"/>Erikiṇa: to simplify still more the medial letter ‘k’ has been
<div n="lb"/>dropped by the process of elision.<sup>176</sup> The meaning of the word
<div n="lb"/>Erikiṇa is a puzzle but its connexion with erakā ‘a kind of
<div n="lb"/>grass,<sup>177</sup> found in that area may be accepted as a hypothesis.

 {%Pur or Pura%}¦
<div n="lb"/>Pur is a word of frequent occurrence in the Ṛgveda.<sup>209</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>early Vedic Āryans were not city builders. Puras<sup>210</sup> which are
<div n="lb"/>mentioned from the context seem to have been always associ-
<div n="lb"/>ated with the dasyus and the enemies of the Āryans.<sup>211</sup> Pura,
<div n="lb"/>the oldest Sanskrit word denoting city, is usually derived from
<div n="lb"/>the Dravidian {%ur.%} From what we read in the Ṛgveda about
<div n="lb"/>Puraṃdara's exploits in connection with the destruction of
<div n="lb"/>the ninety-nine puras of the Asuras who had been causing
<div n="lb"/>havoc to the gods, these puras seem to refer to the cities of
<div n="lb"/>the Indus Valley pre-Āryans.<sup>212</sup> But the word {%ur%} is not availa-
<div n="lb"/>ble in Dravidian lexicons: on the contrary it is pura which is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned by them.<sup>213</sup> The word {%ur%} is not to be traced in the
<div n="lb"/>I. E. languages.<sup>214</sup> We find {%Ur%} only as the name of a town in
<div n="lb"/>Babylonia.<sup>215</sup> In Tamil country, in the inscriptions of the
<div n="lb"/>Chola dynasty (A.D. 900-1300) the word {%‘ur’%} is used to
<div n="lb"/>refer to ‘The Primary Assembly of the villagers’ in the case of
<div n="lb"/>ordinary villages while in the same context the word Sabhā is
<div n="lb"/>used in case of Agrahāra villages, mostly tenanted by learned
<div n="lb"/>brāhmaṇas.<sup>216</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the later Vedic literature<sup>217</sup> the word Pur meant ‘rampart’,
<div n="lb"/>‘fort’, or ‘stronghold’. The meaning of Pura as ‘city’ developed
<div n="lb"/>later and was not at all in vogue in the Vedic literature.
<div n="P"/>Lexicons define it as a place containing large buildings
<div n="lb"/>surrounded by a ditch and extending not less than one Kośa in
<div n="lb"/>length, if it extends for half that distance it is called a kheṭa;
<div n="lb"/>if less than that, a karvaṭa or small market town, any smaller
<div n="lb"/>cluster of houses is called a grāma or village.<sup>218</sup> The Sama-
[Page-225+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>rāṅgaṇasūtradhāra describes puras as being of three kinds —
<div n="lb"/>Big, middle and small which have different measurements for
<div n="lb"/>their ditches, buildings, streets and road-ways.<sup>219</sup> The big one
<div n="lb"/>possesses a circumference of four thousand arcs, the middle of
<div n="lb"/>two thousand arcs and the small of one thousand arcs.<sup>220</sup>
<div n="lb"/>T. Burrow derives pura from §pri to fill Piparti ‘fills’: pur ‘city’:
<div n="lb"/>Lithuanian pilis (l becomes r).<sup>221</sup> We find the word being spelt
<div n="lb"/>in two ways pur<sup>222</sup> and pura<sup>223</sup> Pur (city), from puru (much)
<div n="lb"/>and pūrṇa (full) means ‘plentitude’ or multitude of settlers.
<div n="lb"/>Similarly Greek polis (city) from poly (much): Latin populus
<div n="lb"/>(population, people) from plenus (full), and English folk from
<div n="lb"/>full. Pur is the city and puruṣa the citizen. Greek polites
<div n="lb"/>(citizens), is preserved in politics (civic concerns), police (city
<div n="lb"/>administration), and cosmopolitan (citizen of the world):
<div n="lb"/>Lithuanian pilis (fort, castle).<sup>224</sup> In modern times the word
<div n="lb"/>purā (from pura) is used for mohalla in India. It seems to be
<div n="lb"/>the result of Muslim contact.<sup>225</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pura, where it does not retain the original from pur, is
<div n="lb"/>changed into the following<sup>226</sup>:
<div n="HI"/>(a) Wār: as Purushapura, Peshawar; Nalapura, Narwar;
<div n="lb"/>Matipura, Madwār; Śalwapura, Alwar; Candrapura,
<div n="lb"/>Candwar.
<div n="P"/>(b) Urs or ur, as Māyāpura, Mayura; Siṃhapura, Siṅgur;
<div n="lb"/>Juṣkapura, Zukur
<div n="P"/>(c) Or, as Traipura, Tcor; Candrādityapura, Caindor
<div n="P"/>(d) Ora, as Ilbalapura, Ellora
<div n="P"/>(e) Ore, as Lavapura, Lahore
<div n="P"/>(f) Ola, as Āryapura, Aihole
<div n="P"/>(g) ar, as Kusumapura, Kumrār
<div n="P"/>(h) aur, as Siddhapura, Siddhaur
<div n="P"/>(i) Own, as Hiraṇyapura, Hindoun or Herdoun
<div n="P"/>There are many names with the suffix Pura in the Aṣṭā-
<div n="lb"/>dhyāyī, Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya and the Kāśikā.<sup>227</sup> The word
<div n="lb"/>Mahāpura in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>228</sup> and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>229</sup>
<div n="lb"/>denotes a great fortress. Probably the only difference between
<div n="lb"/>the Pur and Mahāpura was in their size.<sup>230</sup>
<div n="P"/>Following are the place-names ending in the suffix pura:

<div n="lb"/>In Inscription No. 12, we find the mention of the town of Aja-
[Page-226+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>pura. The name of the viṣaya of which it was a part has been
<div n="lb"/>damaged. Since the column bearing the inscription was origi-
<div n="lb"/>nally found in front of the northern gate of the odl fort of
<div n="lb"/>Bihar,<sup>231</sup> we can easily identify Ajapura with the modern vill-
<div n="lb"/>age of the same name in the Rājagṛha viṣaya which is not very
<div n="lb"/>far from Nālandā.<sup>232</sup> The name of the viṣaya which included
<div n="lb"/>this town can possibly be restored as Rājagṛha in the damaged
<div n="lb"/>part of the inscription.

<L>368<pc>226<k1>daSapura<k2>daSapura
(3) {%Daśapura%}¦ (No. 17, L. 4, L. 16):
<div n="lb"/>In this inscription L. 4 refers to the migration of a guild of silk-
<div n="lb"/>weavers from Lāṭa viṣaya (Central and Southern Gujarat) to
<div n="lb"/>the city of Daśapura. The guild came to this city attracted by
<div n="lb"/>the virtues of its kings.<sup>234</sup> The inscription refers itself to the
<div n="lb"/>reign of king Kumāragupta, under whom Bandhuvarman, the
<div n="lb"/>son of Viśvavarman<sup>235</sup> was the governor at Daśapura. L. 16 of
<div n="lb"/>the inscription records that it was under the governorship of
<div n="lb"/>Bandhuvarman (in Mālava era 493 = A.D. 437)<sup>236</sup>, that a lofty
<div n="lb"/>temple of the Sun-god was caused to be built by the guild of
<div n="lb"/>silk-cloth weavers at Daśapura.<sup>237</sup> Afterwards, under other
<div n="lb"/>kings, part of this temple fell into disrepair. And then it was
<div n="lb"/>restored by the same guild in the year 529 of the Mālava era
<div n="lb"/>(= A.D. 473).<sup>238</sup>
<div n="P"/>Daśapura has been identified with Mandasor in Western
<div n="lb"/>Malwa<sup>239</sup> formerly in the Gwalior State. The ancient Daśapura
<div n="lb"/>stood on the north or left bank of the Siwana, a tributary of
<div n="lb"/>the river Śiprā.<sup>240</sup> We also find it mentioned in the Mandasor
<div n="lb"/>Fragmentary Inscription of the time of Ādityavardhana (A.D.
<div n="lb"/>490-500).<sup>241</sup> Under the Imperial Guptas the use of the Mālava
<div n="lb"/>or the Kṛta era seems to have been confined to Daśapura.<sup>242</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Thus Daśapura may have been the main city of the Western
<div n="lb"/>Mālavas. We also get a reference to Daśapura in the Bṛhat-
<div n="lb"/>saṃhitā<sup>243</sup> and the Meghadūta<sup>244</sup> of Kālidāsa.
<div n="P"/>The ancient Sanskrit name Daśapura also occurs in an early
<div n="lb"/>Nasik inscription of Uṣavadāta,<sup>245</sup> and in one inscription of
<div n="lb"/>Vikram Saṃvat 1321 (= A.D. 1264) from Mandasor itself.<sup>246</sup>
<div n="P"/>There are two explanations of the name Daśapura or Dasor.
<div n="lb"/>The local explanation is that the place was originally a city of
[Page-227+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>the Puranic king Daśaratha. But, on this view, the name of the
<div n="lb"/>city should have been Daśarathapura or Dasrathore. Fleet
<div n="lb"/>points out that even now, the township includes some twelve
<div n="lb"/>to fifteen outlying hamelets or divisions (Khilcipur, Jankūpurā,
<div n="lb"/>Rāmpuriyā, Candrapurā, Bālagañja, etc.) and that ‘when it was
<div n="lb"/>originally constituted, it included exactly ten (daśa) such ham-
<div n="lb"/>lets (pura)’.<sup>247</sup> This view of Fleet is more appealing.
<div n="P"/>Mandasor, the full form of the name of the town by which
<div n="lb"/>it is officially known and which is entered in maps, is also
<div n="lb"/>explained in two ways:
<div n="P"/>As suggested by Bhagwan Lal Indraji, it may represent
<div n="lb"/>Manda-Daśapura, “the distressed or afflicted Daśapura,” referr-
<div n="lb"/>ing to the overthrow of the town, and the destruction of the
<div n="lb"/>Hindu temples in it, by the Musalmans, in memory of which,
<div n="lb"/>even to the present day, the Nāgar brāhmaṇas of the area do
<div n="lb"/>not drink water there. This is supported by the fact that some
<div n="lb"/>paṇḍits still call it Mannadasor.<sup>248</sup>
<div n="P"/>F.S. Growse suggests that the name combines the two
<div n="lb"/>names of Mad and Daśapura: the former<sup>249</sup> being the name of
<div n="lb"/>a village (also called Afzalpur) about eleven miles south-east of
<div n="lb"/>Mandasor, from which, it is said, were brought, from ruined
<div n="lb"/>Hindu temples, the stones that were used in the construction
<div n="lb"/>of the Musalman fort at Mandasor.<sup>250</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is very difficult to choose between the two explanations,
<div n="lb"/>but the second seems to be more reasonable.

<L>369<pc>227<k1>indrapura<k2>indrapura
(4) {%Indrapura%}¦ (No. 16, L. 5, L. 6, L. 7, L. 8):
<div n="lb"/>The inscription states that an endowment was given by a brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa named Devaviṣṇu for the maintenance of a lamp in a
<div n="lb"/>temple of the Sun established by the merchants of the town of
<div n="lb"/>Indrapura kṣatriyas named Acalavarman and Bhrukuṇṭhasiṃha
<div n="lb"/>at Indrapura.
<div n="P"/>In line 5 we get ‘Candrāpuraka-Padmā’ as the reading
<div n="lb"/>taken by Fleet<sup>251</sup> and he thus considers it a separate town than
<div n="lb"/>Indrapura.<sup>252</sup> But the correct reading should be as ‘Cendra-
<div n="lb"/>puraka-Padmā’, since we find a small stroke by the left side of
<div n="lb"/>‘c’. The stroke in other lines for ‘e’ is very clear (e. g. in L. 2)
<div n="lb"/>though it is not very clear in L. 5 still we cannot read it simply
<div n="lb"/>‘c’. The reading ‘ce’ for ‘c’ has been suggested by Sircar and
<div n="lb"/>Jagannath.<sup>253</sup> Thus we see that the Padmā referred in line 5
[Page-228+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>of this inscription also belongs to Indrapura.
<div n="P"/>Now we find two different spellings of Indrāpura in lines 5
<div n="lb"/>and 6 and Indrapura in lines 7 and 8.<sup>254</sup>
<div n="P"/>What we can find out here is that the affix ‘ka’ in lines 5
<div n="lb"/>and 6 is very important which seems to have grammatically a
<div n="lb"/>succinct purpose here. The vṛddhi of the first vowel ‘i’ was
<div n="lb"/>desirable here as is also clear by the use of affix ‘ka’ in the
<div n="lb"/>Allahabad Inscription of Samudragupta.<sup>255</sup> So it is a weaker
<div n="lb"/>form of the affix ‘ka’, without vṛddhi of the vowel in the first
<div n="lb"/>syllable.<sup>256</sup> The writer seems to have used the long vowel
<div n="lb"/>(with the last syllable of Indra) instead of vṛddhi in the first
<div n="lb"/>syllable to avoid confusion between Aindrapura and Indrapura.
<div n="lb"/>We do not find any such example of the elongation of vowel
<div n="lb"/>in the classical Sanskrit literature though we find its rare use
<div n="lb"/>in Vedic literature.<sup>257</sup> So we shall translate ‘Indrāpuraka Pad-
<div n="lb"/>mā’ as ‘Padmā of (the town of) Indrapura and ‘Indrapuraka-
<div n="lb"/>vaṇigbhyām’ as ‘merchants of (the town of) Indrapura’. This
<div n="lb"/>Indrapura is the same as modern Indor,<sup>258</sup> near Dibhāi, Buland-
<div n="lb"/>shahr district, U.P.<sup>259</sup> The ancient town of Indrapura was
<div n="lb"/>situated on a large and lofty mound about five miles to the
<div n="lb"/>north-west of Dibhāi.<sup>260</sup> Now-a-days it is only a kheḍā or deser-
<div n="lb"/>ted mound, and is not shown in maps<sup>261</sup>

<L>370<pc>228<k1>kartfpura<k2>kartfpura
(5) {%Kartṛpura%}¦ (No. I, L. 22):
<div n="P"/>Though the most accepted and correct reading is Kartṛpura,
<div n="lb"/>some scholars prefer to read Katṛipura<sup>262</sup> or Kātripura.<sup>263</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is one of the five frontier kingdoms<sup>264</sup> mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>inscription whose kings did homage and paid tribute to Samu-
<div n="lb"/>dragupta. Scholars differ in their views about the identification
<div n="lb"/>of this place-name:
<div n="P"/>According to smith,<sup>265</sup> this kingdom ‘occupied the lower
<div n="lb"/>ranges of the western Himalayas, including probably Kumaon,
<div n="lb"/>Garhwal, and Kangra’. Oldham<sup>266</sup> holds that the kingdom of
<div n="lb"/>Kātripura, included Kumaun, Almora, Garhwal and Kangra.
<div n="lb"/>Fleet<sup>267</sup> suggests that the name may survive in Kartarpur in
<div n="lb"/>the Jullundur district.
<div n="P"/>We prefer the view of Daśaratha Sharma.<sup>268</sup> His conten-
<div n="lb"/>tion is that amongst the five frontier kingdoms mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>the inscription, the first three belong to the East, the fourth
<div n="lb"/>one belongs to the North, hence it will be better to leave aside
[Page-229+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>the northern and eastern sides of the empire and to look for
<div n="lb"/>Kartṛpura somewhere to the west of the Gupta dominions.
<div n="lb"/>Consequently he finds Karor or Karūr to be a good equivalent
<div n="lb"/>for Kartṛpura.<sup>269</sup> Kara here stands for Kartṛ and ‘ur’ or ‘ūr’
<div n="lb"/>would stand here for pura.<sup>270</sup> Karūr, again, is to be perferred
<div n="lb"/>to the other alternatives on account of its associations with the
<div n="lb"/>Gupta period of Indian History. According to Al-Beruni, an
<div n="lb"/>eastern king, called Vikramāditya, put to flight and killed a
<div n="lb"/>Śaka ruler in the region of Karūr, between Multan and Loni.<sup>271</sup>
<div n="lb"/>This Vikramāditya is to be identified with Candragupta II
<div n="lb"/>‘the enemy of the Śakas’, who disguised as his brother's wife,
<div n="lb"/>Dhruvasvāminī, ‘ripped upon the belley of the Śaka ruler’,
<div n="lb"/>and destroyed the Śaka army, most probably, in Kartṛpura or
<div n="lb"/>Karūr.<sup>272</sup>
<div n="P"/>This was the first encounter between the Śakas and Vikramā-
<div n="lb"/>ditya, and Karūr, Karor, or Kartṛpura was the theatre of the
<div n="lb"/>war because of its intermediate position between the Śaka
<div n="lb"/>dominions and the Gupta empire.<sup>273</sup>

<div n="lb"/>Kusthalapura ruled by Dhanañjaya is mentioned as one of
<div n="lb"/>the Dakṣiṇāpatha kingdoms subdued by Samudragupta. Smith
<div n="lb"/>takes it to be a mistake for Kuśasthalapura,<sup>278</sup> and identifies
<div n="lb"/>it with the holy city of Dwarka, the capital of Ānartta, i. e.
<div n="lb"/>North Gujarat.<sup>279</sup> Raj Bali Pandey also identifies it with
<div n="lb"/>Kuśasthalī (Dwarka)<sup>280</sup> G. Ramdas locates the place in
<div n="lb"/>Gujarat following Smith.<sup>281</sup> Monier Williams also indentifies
<div n="lb"/>Kuśasthala with the town of Dwarka.<sup>282</sup> Bhandarkar, follow-
<div n="lb"/>ing Barnett identifies the place with Kuttalur near Polur in
<div n="lb"/>North Arcot.<sup>283</sup>
<div n="P"/>This Kuśasthalī is not situated in Gujarat but presumably on
<div n="lb"/>the eastern spurs of the Vindhya range near Daksiṇakosala.<sup>284</sup>
<div n="lb"/>It was the capital of Kuśa, son of Rāmacandra.<sup>285</sup> But its
[Page-230+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>position in the list of the States of Dakṣiṇāpatha indicates a
<div n="lb"/>place a little more to the south.
<div n="P"/>By the process of Haplology,<sup>286</sup> Kuśasthalapura is simpli-
<div n="lb"/>fied into Kusthalapura which may be changed to Kuśasthalī
<div n="lb"/>or Kuśāvatī in short.
<div n="P"/>The suffix sthala or sthalī is significant: it suggests a high-
<div n="lb"/>lying country, an eminence, tableland, or dry-land as opposed
<div n="lb"/>to a damp low-land.<sup>287</sup> The Mahābhārata, Harivaṃśa, early
<div n="lb"/>Jain and Pali literature use the word in this sense.<sup>288</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Mahābhārata mentions both Kuśasthala as well as kuśa-sthalī.

<div n="lb"/>tion No. 6 mentions Vīrasena, the child of Kutsa, the minister

<div n="lb"/>ings of the words, and logic, and (the ways of) mankind,
<div n="lb"/>who was a poet and who belonged to (the city of) Pāṭali-
<div n="lb"/>putra.<sup>290</sup> Inscription No. 1 mentions a city named Puṣpa
<div n="lb"/>where Samudragupta enjoyed playfully while he was young.<sup>291</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Apparently, the city was the Gupta capital. We also find the
<div n="lb"/>word Pāṭaliputa (Pāṭaliputra) used by Aśoka, in his rock
<div n="lb"/>edicts.<sup>292</sup> The city was also known as Kusumapura due to the
<div n="lb"/>abundance of flowers.<sup>293</sup> Its name Puṣpapura is also met with
<div n="lb"/>in the Raghuvaṃśa.<sup>294</sup> It is mentioned in the Mudrārākṣasa
<div n="lb"/>as well.<sup>295</sup> The Kathāsaritsāgara of Somadeva<sup>296</sup> (11th century)
<div n="lb"/>describes it as a place of both wealth and education though
<div n="lb"/>generally there is a fight between Śrī (lakṣmī) and Sarasvatī.<sup>297</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kāvyamīmāṃsā of Rājaśekhara (A.D. 900) mentions a
<div n="lb"/>tradition that there were assemblies of scholars called brahma-
<div n="lb"/>sabhās, organised by kings, which examined poets like Kālidāsa,
<div n="lb"/>Bhartṛmaṇṭha, Amara, Rūpa, Āryaśūra, Bhāravi and Candra-
<div n="lb"/>gupta in Viśālā (Ujjainī) and where such great masters of gram-
<div n="lb"/>mar as Upavarṣa, Pāṇini, Piṅgala, Vyāḍi, Vararūci and
<div n="lb"/>Patañjali were examined in Pāṭaliputra and attained fame.<sup>298</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa<sup>299</sup> (A.D. 800) mentions Pāṭali-
<div n="lb"/>putra as Nandanagara. This work refers to king Nanda, his
<div n="lb"/>learned Council of brāhmaṇa philosophers and to his intimacy
<div n="lb"/>with Pāṇini. “After him (Sūrasena) there will be king Nanda
[Page-231+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>at Puṣpa city. In the capital of the Magadha residents there
<div n="lb"/>will be brāhmaṇa controversialists and the king will be surroun-
<div n="lb"/>ded by them. The king will give them riches. His minister was
<div n="lb"/>a Buddhist brāhmaṇa, Vararūci, who was of high soul, kind
<div n="lb"/>and good. His great friend was a brāhmaṇa, Pāṇini by
<div n="lb"/>name”.<sup>300</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kāśikā<sup>301</sup> records two divisions of Pāṭaliputra:
<div n="P"/>1. Pūrva-Pāṭaliputra (eastern on the Gaṅgā)
<div n="P"/>2. Apara-Pāṭaliputra (western on the Śoṇa)
<div n="P"/>Patañjali<sup>302</sup> mentions the western Pāṭaliputra. A citizen
<div n="lb"/>of Pāṭaliputra was called Pāṭaliputraka.<sup>303</sup>
<div n="P"/>The city is named as Palibothra by Megasthenes, the Am-
<div n="lb"/>bassador of Seleucus Nicator at the court of King Candragupta
<div n="lb"/>Maurya.<sup>304</sup> The Pāla inscriptions refer to it by the name
<div n="lb"/>Śrīnagara.<sup>305</sup>
<div n="P"/>The termination ‘Putra’ in Pāṭaliputra is difficult to
<div n="lb"/>explain. We find it being used with ‘Brahman’ to denote
<div n="lb"/>the river ‘Brahmaputra’. As regards places-names we find the
<div n="lb"/>mention of Saitya puta (Satiya-putra) and Kerala-puta (Kerala
<div n="lb"/>putra) in Aśokan Rock-edicts.<sup>306</sup>
<div n="P"/>The name Pāṭaliputra is taken to mean “the son (putra) of
<div n="lb"/>Pāṭali, i. e. the trumpet flower. The words Puṣpapura and
<div n="lb"/>Kusumapura also mean ‘a city of flowers’. The word ‘Śrīnag-
<div n="lb"/>ara’ means ‘a beautiful city.<sup>307</sup> Because of the abundance of
<div n="lb"/>flowers the city may have looked beautiful. It was known by
<div n="lb"/>other names also, viz., Puṣpapura, Puspapurī and Kusumapura.<sup>308</sup>
<div n="lb"/>According to Yuan-Chwang, it had been called Kusumapura
<div n="lb"/>(K' u-su-mo-pu-lo) on account of the numerous flowers (kus-
<div n="lb"/>uma) in the royal enclosure.<sup>309</sup> Later its glory was replaced by
<div n="lb"/>that of Kānyakubja which came to be known as Kusumapura.<sup>310</sup>
<div n="P"/>The meaning of ‘Pāṭaliputra’ is explained in the legendary
<div n="lb"/>origin of the city. According to the legend: there was a
<div n="lb"/>brāhmaṇa of high talent and singular learning. Many flocked
<div n="lb"/>to him to receive instruction. One day all his students went
<div n="lb"/>out on a tour of observation. One of them looked very sad.
<div n="lb"/>When asked, he told that his life was waning without any
<div n="lb"/>company. In a joke his friends made the Pāṭali tree, under
<div n="lb"/>which they were standing, his father-in-law: in other words
<div n="lb"/>he was to marry the daughter of the tree, or a Pāṭali flower

<div n="lb"/>the students proposed to return home but the young student
<div n="lb"/>fascinated by love stayed there fearlessly. Accidentally, next
<div n="lb"/>day he was married with the young daughter of an old couple.
<div n="lb"/>After a year his wife gave birth to a son. He declined to stay
<div n="lb"/>there fearing the exposure to wind and weather. But the
<div n="lb"/>old man (the father of the wife) constructed a house for him
<div n="lb"/>and made him stay there. When the old capital of Kusuma-
<div n="lb"/>pura was changed, this town was chosen, and “as the genie
<div n="lb"/>built the mansion for the youth the country was named as
<div n="lb"/>Pāṭaliputrapura (the city of the son of the Pāṭali tree).”<sup>312</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is not unlikely that originally the name of the city was
<div n="lb"/>Pāṭaliputrapura and that later suffix Pura was dropped.
<div n="P"/>The Buddhist literature informs us that Pāṭaliputra was
<div n="lb"/>originally a village known as Pāṭaligāma. Ajātaśatru is said
<div n="lb"/>to have fortified it in order to check the attacks of the Licc-
<div n="lb"/>havis who often harassed its inhabitants. The Buddha on his
<div n="lb"/>way from Rājagṛha to Vaiśālī, passed through this village
<div n="lb"/>on his last journey and is said to have predicted that the village
<div n="lb"/>was destined to become a great city.<sup>313</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Vāyu-Purāṇa attributes the real foundation of Pāṭali-
<div n="lb"/>putra to Rājā Ajāta-Śatru's grandson, Udaya or Udayāśva.
<div n="lb"/>It was he who first removed the capital from Rājagṛha to
<div n="lb"/>Pāṭaliputra (during the last part of the 6th century B.C.)<sup>314</sup>
<div n="P"/>Pāṭaliputra had closely been associated with multifarious
<div n="lb"/>political and cultural activities right from the fifth century
<div n="lb"/>B.C. to the later part of the sixth century A.D.<sup>315</sup> It had the
<div n="lb"/>honour to be the capital of the Śaiśunāgas, the Nandas, the
<div n="lb"/>Mauryas and the great Imperial Guptas uptil the Hūṇa inva-
<div n="lb"/>sion in the 6th century A.D. when it was ruined. Harṣavardhana
<div n="lb"/>(7th century A.D.) made no attempt to restore it.<sup>316</sup> Śaśāṅka
<div n="lb"/>Narendragupta destroyed many Buddhist temples and monas-
<div n="lb"/>teries at Pāṭaliputra.<sup>317</sup> Dharmapāla, the most powerful of
<div n="lb"/>the Pāla kings of Bengal and Bihar, tried to restore its glory.<sup>318</sup>
<div n="P"/>Coming to medieval times, we find that it remained deserted
<div n="lb"/>for a number of centuries. It was Sher Shah, who, in about
<div n="lb"/>A.D. 1541 occupied it again as a royal city and built a fort
<div n="lb"/>there. It then came into importance under its modern name
<div n="lb"/>Patna (from Skt. Pattana) i. e. the town or city. It is even now
[Page-233+ 36]
<div n="lb"/>the capital of Bihar.<sup>319</sup>

<div n="lb"/>Mahendragiri is mentioned as its king. Piṣṭapura is the same
<div n="lb"/>as the fortress Piṣṭapura captured by the Cālukya king
<div n="lb"/>Pulakeśin II. The Tāṇḍivāda grant of Pṛthivī Mahārāja also
<div n="lb"/>refers to Piṣṭapura.<sup>321</sup> Piṣṭapura is modern Pithapuram in the
<div n="lb"/>Godavari district of the Madras Presidency.<sup>322</sup> It was the
<div n="lb"/>capital of Kaliṅga.<sup>323</sup> ‘Kaliṅgādhipati’ Anantavarman issued
<div n="lb"/>a grant<sup>324</sup> from the victorious city of Piṣṭapura. This grant
<div n="lb"/>records that Anantavarman's grandfather Guṇavarman ruled
<div n="lb"/>over Devarāṣṭra with Piṣṭapura as its chief city.<sup>325</sup> In our
<div n="lb"/>inscription Devarāṣṭra<sup>326</sup> has been treated separately. It seems
<div n="lb"/>that during Samudragupta's time these two States (Devarāṣṭra
<div n="lb"/>and Kaliṅga) were separate states but later on under Guṇavar-
<div n="lb"/>man they were amalgamated.
<div n="P"/>Guha ruled over the whole of Kaliṅga and the neighbour-
<div n="lb"/>ing regions.<sup>327</sup> Guha belonged to the Sālaṅkāyana family of
<div n="lb"/>brāhmaṇas. Samudragupta installed him as his viceroy in
<div n="lb"/>Kaliṅga.<sup>328</sup> Guha was already reigning over Kaliṅga (with his
<div n="lb"/>capital at Piṣṭapura) when Samudragupta conquered him and
<div n="lb"/>placed him as his feudatory. ‘Mahendragiri’ may have been
<div n="lb"/>another name given to him on account of the extension of
<div n="lb"/>his dominion over the Mahendra mountain.<sup>329</sup> It is interesting
<div n="lb"/>to note that Kālidāsa<sup>330</sup> refers to Raghu defeating a king
<div n="lb"/>named Mahendranātha in the course of his southern campaign.
<div n="lb"/>It is tempting to connect Mahendranātha with Mahendragiri.
<div n="lb"/>After the victory of Samudragupta, Guha was confirmed in
<div n="lb"/>the enjoyment of sovereignty under the imperial tutelage.<sup>331</sup>
<div n="P"/>At Piṣṭapura there is a Vaiṣṇava temple named Kunti-

 {%Nagara:%}¦
<div n="lb"/>Nagara means a town, a city.<sup>335</sup> we find the term being
<div n="lb"/>used by Pāṇini (IV. 2. 142).<sup>336</sup> The word Nāgaraka (or
<div n="lb"/>Nāgarika)<sup>337</sup> also occurs in Sanskrit literature as standing for
<div n="lb"/>‘an inhabitant of a town’ but sometimes its use was restricted
<div n="lb"/>for the chief of a town or a police-officer. In modern times
<div n="lb"/>nāgarika is used to refer to ‘a citizen of a state whether living
<div n="lb"/>in city or village’.
<div n="P"/>In the early Vedic literature Nagara is found only as the
<div n="lb"/>derivative adjective Nagarin, used as a proper name, but it
<div n="lb"/>appears in the sense of ‘town’ in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (1. 11,
<div n="lb"/>18: 31, 4) and frequently in the later works.<sup>338</sup>
<div n="P"/>Nagara is an important factor which helps us to distinguish
<div n="lb"/>Janapada from rāṣṭra: nagara forms a part of the rāṣṭra but
<div n="lb"/>is excluded from the Janapada.<sup>339</sup> Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra
<div n="lb"/>uses Nagara and Pura as synonyms.<sup>340</sup> It is significant that
<div n="lb"/>the word Nagara is of late occurrence.<sup>341</sup> It is likely
<div n="lb"/>that in the early Vedic times city life does not seem to have
<div n="lb"/>developed much. In the Epic,<sup>342</sup> there are references to
<div n="lb"/>Nagara, ‘a city’: Grāma ‘Village’: and Ghoṣa ‘ranch’. Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature especially of the earlier period is generally confined
<div n="lb"/>to the village. The siege of puras is mentioned in the Saṃhitās
<div n="lb"/>and Brāhmaṇas.
<div n="P"/>The word Nagara is changed into:<sup>343</sup>
<div n="P"/>(a) Nar as Kuśīnagara, Kusinar, Girinagara, Girnar
<div n="P"/>(b) Ner as Jīrṇanagara, Jooner.
<div n="P"/>In modern times the suffix nagara is sometimes used to

<div n="lb"/>Wilson in his dictionary, refers to Sāketa as ‘the city of
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā’. Several passages in the Raghuvaṃśa<sup>362</sup> confirm it.
<div n="lb"/>The Vividhatīrthakalpa mentions Sākeyam (Sāketa) as a
<div n="lb"/>synonym for Ayodhyā,<sup>363</sup> but in the Buddhist literature we find
<div n="lb"/>separate references to Ayodhyā and Sāketa which creates
<div n="lb"/>doubt about their identity and suggests that the two existed
<div n="lb"/>separately.<sup>364</sup> V. Pathak quotes a well known verse occurring
<div n="lb"/>in the Yuga Purāṇa, a section of Gārgī Saṃhitā,<sup>365</sup> to show
<div n="lb"/>that Sāketa is the same as Ayodhyā. But there is nothing in
<div n="lb"/>the passage to support the view.
<div n="P"/>The ancient city of Ayodhyā or Sāketa is described in the
<div n="lb"/>Rāmāyaṇa as situated on the banks of the Sarayū or Sarjū
<div n="lb"/>river.<sup>366</sup> During the Buddhist period, Ayodhyā was divided into
[Page-237+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Uttara (Northern) Kosala and Dakṣiṇa (Southern) Kosala.
<div n="lb"/>The river Sarayū was the dividing line between the two pro-
<div n="lb"/>vinces. Ayodhyā was the capital of the latter.<sup>367</sup> Ancient
<div n="lb"/>tradition believes it to have been built by Manu.<sup>368</sup>
<div n="P"/>The history of Kośala, with its mighty King Prasenajit and
<div n="lb"/>his son Vidudabha pales into insignificance with the emergence
<div n="lb"/>of the Magadhan rulers as powerful antagonists. The Nandas,
<div n="lb"/>followed by the Mauryas, assimilated Kośala in their empire.
<div n="lb"/>Under the Śuṅgas, it was being ruled by a viceroy. An inscrip-
<div n="lb"/>tion from Ayodhyā mentions Puṣyamitra as having performed
<div n="lb"/>two horse-sacrifices. Under the Kuṣāṇas, the city remained
<div n="lb"/>more or less in oblivion. Subsequently in the Purāṇas it figures
<div n="lb"/>along with Prayāga and Magadha as forming part of
<div n="lb"/>the kingdom of the Guptas. The spurious Gayā Plate of
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta (No. 21) mentions it as a seat of a Gupta
<div n="lb"/>camp of victory. The history of the city in the post-
<div n="lb"/>Gupta period is wrapped up in obscurity. It was within the
<div n="lb"/>empire of the Pratihāras and Gāhaḍavālas of Kanauj. Ayodhyā
<div n="lb"/>is described by Muslim historians<sup>369</sup> to have been a wilder-
<div n="lb"/>ness.
<div n="P"/>The Slaves and Khilji rulers held sway over it, and subse-
<div n="lb"/>quently it received importance as the headquarters of Oudh.
<div n="lb"/>It was under the charge of Muslim governors appointed from
<div n="lb"/>Delhi, but with the emergence of Jaunpur as a strong kingdom
<div n="lb"/>Ayodhyā was completely over-shadowed. It was a mint-town
<div n="lb"/>in the time of Akbar, but there is no reference to it in later
<div n="lb"/>Chronicles.<sup>370</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ayodhyā is important as a centre of pilgrimage. There are
<div n="lb"/>several places in the city connected with different events in the
<div n="lb"/>life of Rāma. Rāma was born at a place called Janmasthāna. At
<div n="lb"/>Chīrodaka also called Chīrasāgara, Daśaratha performed, with
<div n="lb"/>the help of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga Ṛṣi, the sacrifices for obtaining a son.
<div n="lb"/>At a place called Tretā-kā-Ṭhākur, Rāmacandra performed the
<div n="lb"/>horse sacrifice by setting up the image of Sītā. At Ratnamaṇ-
<div n="lb"/>ḍapa, he held his Council,<sup>371</sup> at Swargadwāram in Fyzabad,
<div n="lb"/>his body was burnt. At Lakṣmaṇa-kuṇḍa, Lakṣmaṇa disappeared
<div n="lb"/>in the river Sarayū. Daśaratha accidentally killed Śravaṇa,

<div n="P"/>It means an inhabited place, village, hamlet.<sup>383</sup> It seems
<div n="lb"/>that firstly the word grāma denoted the collective inhabi-
<div n="lb"/>tants of a place, community or race. Later on this sense was
<div n="lb"/>transferred to an inhabitation and was used in the sense of a
<div n="lb"/>village. The earlier usage of this word, which occurs frequently
<div n="lb"/>from the Ṛgveda<sup>384</sup> onwards, appears to have been in the sense
<div n="lb"/>of a village. The early Āryans must have dwelt in villages which
<div n="lb"/>were scattered over the country, some close together, some far
<div n="lb"/>apart, and were connected by roads.<sup>385</sup> In the early Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature village is regularly contrasted with the forest (āraṇya)

<div n="lb"/>consisted of detached houses with enclosures, but no details
<div n="lb"/>are to be found in Vedic literature. Large villages (mahā-

<div n="lb"/>be regarded more correctly as an aggregate of several fami-
<div n="lb"/>lies, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan
<div n="lb"/>(viś), as is often the case at the present day.<sup>389</sup> The head of the
<div n="lb"/>village was called Grāmaṇi or ‘the leader of the village’. The
<div n="lb"/>king's share in a village is referred to as early as the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda.<sup>390</sup>
<div n="P"/>Villages played an important role as a unit of Rāṣṭra or

<div n="lb"/>Nepal.<sup>404</sup> But scholars<sup>405</sup> are not right in co-relating Doṅgā-
<div n="lb"/>grāma with Himavac-Chikhara, Inscription No. 36 clarifies it.
<div n="lb"/>There is a long gap between the references to Himavac-
<div n="lb"/>Chikhara and Doṅgā-grāma. Actually Himavac-Chikhara is
<div n="lb"/>associated with Kokāmukhasvāmin (a form of the Boar incar-
<div n="lb"/>nation of Viṣṇu) and Śvetavarāhasvāmin where originally (ādya)
<div n="lb"/>these gods were installed in a temple. The name Doṅgā-grāma
<div n="lb"/>is used for the place where the lands were donated by Ṛbhupāla
<div n="lb"/>for the construction of the two temples having the names of the
<div n="lb"/>two deities.<sup>406</sup> The word ‘ādya’ in L. 7 is significant and dis-
<div n="lb"/>tinguishes the temples at Himavac-Chikhara from those at
<div n="lb"/>Doṅgā-grāma. The writer had to use the word ‘Himavac-
<div n="lb"/>Chikhara’ again in L. 10, with the names of Kokāmukhasvāmin
<div n="lb"/>and Śvetavarāhasvāmin in order to avoid confusion between
<div n="lb"/>the temples at the two places. For the temple at Doṅgā-grāma
<div n="lb"/>the writer uses the word ‘iha’ in L. 11. We also find the word
<div n="lb"/>‘Himavac-Chikhara’ absent in another Dāmodarpur Copper
<div n="lb"/>Plate Inscription of the Gupta Year 224 (= A.D. 543), where
<div n="lb"/>a person named Amṛtadeva hailing from Ayodhyā donates a
<div n="lb"/>land for the repairs and worship, etc., at the temple of Lord
<div n="lb"/>Śvetavarāhasvāmin obviously because he was referring to the
<div n="lb"/>temple at Doṅgā-grāma and there was now, no question of any
<div n="lb"/>confusion or distinction.<sup>407</sup> Thus Doṅgāgrāma does not seem
<div n="lb"/>to have any connection with Himavac-Chikhara. This village
<div n="lb"/>is to be located somewhere near Dāmodarpur and belonged to
<div n="lb"/>the Koṭivarṣa viṣaya as mentioned in the records.<sup>408</sup> But the
<div n="lb"/>village was most probably situated in a hilly area which is clear
<div n="lb"/>from the wrod Doṅgā itself.<sup>409</sup> The word ‘Atrāraṇye’ (local
<div n="lb"/>forest where the temple of Śvetavarāhasvāmin was situated) in
<div n="lb"/>No. 37 also attests to it.<sup>410</sup> The village may have consisted of a
<div n="lb"/>few huts with bushes and trees all around or the place where
<div n="lb"/>the temples were situated was away from habitation.
<div n="P"/>Thus the earlier suggestion that the Koṭivarṣa district
<div n="lb"/>included the hilly region bordering on the northern fringe of
<div n="lb"/>Bengal,<sup>411</sup> which was rejected by Sircar,<sup>412</sup> seems to be
<div n="lb"/>correct.

 {%Kṣetra%}¦
<div n="P"/>Originally meaning an agricultural field, in which sense its
<div n="lb"/>use survives, kṣetra came to be used as a place-name suffix
<div n="lb"/>as we find in the word Kurukṣetra. As a suffix in com-
<div n="lb"/>position it signified simply a ‘field’ for the word preceding it.
<div n="lb"/>For example karma-kṣetra, dharma-kṣetra, raṇa-kṣetra, siddha-
<div n="lb"/>kṣetra, sureśvarī-kṣetra.<sup>480</sup>
<div n="P"/>The use of this word<sup>481</sup> in the Ṛgveda points clearly to the
<div n="lb"/>existence of separate fields<sup>482</sup> carefully measured off,<sup>483</sup> though
<div n="lb"/>in some passages the meaning is less definite, indicating culti-
<div n="lb"/>vated land generally.<sup>484</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>485</sup> and later, the
<div n="lb"/>sense of a separate field is clearly marked, though the more
<div n="lb"/>general use is also found.<sup>486</sup> The deity Kṣetrasya Pati,<sup>487</sup> ‘Lord
<div n="lb"/>of the Field’ should probably be understood as the god presid-
<div n="lb"/>ing over each field, just as Vāstoṣpati presides over each
<div n="lb"/>dwelling.<sup>488</sup>
[Page-249+ 38]
<div n="P"/>Kṣetra is changed into:<sup>489</sup>
<div n="P"/>(a) Chatra as Ahikṣetra, Ahichatra
<div n="P"/>(b) Cchatra as Ahikṣetra, Ahicchatra.
<div n="P"/>In Prakrit Kṣetra changes to Kheṭṭa meaning ‘a land for
<div n="lb"/>agriculture’, country, village and city, etc.<sup>490</sup>
<div n="P"/>Analogous to Kheṭṭa is the word ‘kheḍa’ or ‘kheṭa’ which
<div n="lb"/>means ‘a city surrounded by rivers and mountains’.<sup>491</sup> ‘Kheṭa’
<div n="lb"/>meaning ‘a small hamlet’ is also found in Pāṇini (VI. 2. 126).<sup>492</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra defines ‘Kheṭa’ as the half of a
<div n="lb"/>city and the grāma as the half of a ‘Kheṭa’.<sup>493</sup> According to
<div n="lb"/>Monier Williams Kheṭa means a village, residence of peasants
<div n="lb"/>and farmers, small town (half of a Pura).<sup>494</sup>
<div n="P"/>Lele<sup>495</sup> considers Kheṭa or Kheṭaka to be the dialectic form
<div n="lb"/>of the word ‘Kṣetra’. The original meaning of Kheṭaka or Kheṭa
<div n="lb"/>was an enclosure for cattle. In the course of time the pastoral
<div n="lb"/>camp grew into an agricultural village, and the word Kheṭaka
<div n="lb"/>came to include agricultural village.<sup>496</sup>
<div n="P"/>Here we collect the names of fields appearing in the inscri-
<div n="lb"/>ptions of our study. These names can be attributed to the
<div n="lb"/>names of individuals or gods. As the proper names are a part
<div n="lb"/>of the names of the fields, we treat them as place-names and do
<div n="lb"/>not discuss them in the context of personal-names. Some of
<div n="lb"/>the names sound curious and at places the readings are doubt-
<div n="lb"/>ful, the fascimile of the grant supplied by the editor being
<div n="lb"/>blurred. It is interesting to note that all these names occur
<div n="lb"/>in the same inscription, i. e. Gunaighar Grant of Vainya-
<div n="lb"/>gupta, year 188 (No. 52). Gunaighar formerly Guṇikāgra-
<div n="lb"/>hāra,<sup>497</sup> is a village about 18 miles to the north-west of the
<div n="lb"/>town of Comilla, a mile and a half to the south west of the P.S.
<div n="lb"/>Debidvar in the district of Tippera which is modern Tripur.<sup>498</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The area is predominated by Tibeto-Burman tribes. Hence

<div n="lb"/>The field belonged to Miduvilāla. The word Midu is a Prakritic
<div n="lb"/>form of Sanskrit Mṛdu<sup>504</sup> which means soft, delicate or beauti-
<div n="lb"/>ful. Pāia-Sadda-Mahaṇṇavo<sup>505</sup> takes Vilāla, Birāla, Biḍāla,

<div n="lb"/>cording to Bhattacharya ‘the word vilāla is evidently derived

<div n="lb"/>current in Bengal.<sup>506</sup> D.C. Sircar takes it to be a mechanic
<div n="lb"/>caste like vardhaki (carpenter).<sup>507</sup> We find the word Vilāla
<div n="lb"/>occurring thrice in the Gunaighar grant (No. 52) which has
<div n="lb"/>been translated by the editor of the grant as follows:
<div n="P"/>(a) Miduvilāla-kṣetra (L. 19): The field of Miduvilāla
<div n="P"/>(b) Pakkavilāla-kṣetra (LL. 21-22): The field of Pakkavilāla
<div n="P"/>(c) Gaṇeśvara-Vilāla-Puṣkariṇī (L. 28): the large marshy
<div n="lb"/>pond of Gaṇeśvara.
<div n="P"/>All the three names have been explained according to their
<div n="lb"/>context in this work.
<div n="P"/>In (a) and (b) the editor takes vilāla as a part of the names
<div n="lb"/>Midu and Pakka but in (c) he translates vilāla as ‘a large
[Page-251+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>marshy (place)’. The editor should have taken either Miduvi-
<div n="lb"/>lāla and Pakkavilāla as the adjectives of the fields as in (c) or
<div n="lb"/>Vilāla as an adjective of Gaṇeśvara and not that of Puṣkariṇī.
<div n="lb"/>Vilāla seems to be a part of the names Midu and Pakka which
<div n="lb"/>if left alone yield no meaning, but in the case of Gaṇeśvara
<div n="lb"/>vilāla, the word vilāla seems to be an adjective of the name
<div n="lb"/>Gaṇeśvara rather than a part of it. Here the word vilāla seems

<div n="lb"/>the Brahmaputra valley which being the most powerful state
<div n="lb"/>and being the first to be approached from the western side
<div n="lb"/>came to denote the whole valley.<sup>540</sup> The area of Kāmarūpa
<div n="lb"/>was estimated by the Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang to have
<div n="lb"/>been 10,000 li i. e. 1667 miles in circuit which shows that it
<div n="lb"/>must have comprised the whole valley of Brahmaputra.<sup>541</sup>

<div n="lb"/>(which is the Nilādri or Nīlakūṭa, the name of the Kāmākhyā
<div n="lb"/>hill). According to the Yoginī Tantra, the kingdom of Kāma-
<div n="lb"/>rūpa included the whole of the Brahmaputra valley together

<div n="lb"/>try.<sup>546</sup> In the Raghuvaṃśa,<sup>547</sup> the separate mention of Prāg-
<div n="lb"/>jyotiṣa and Kāmarūpa may seem to be a little puzzling. But
<div n="lb"/>we see that whereas verses 81-82 of the fourth canto refer to
<div n="lb"/>the king of Prāgjyotiṣa as terrified, the subsequent verses
<div n="lb"/>describe the presentation of elephants and the offer of respects
<div n="lb"/>by the king of Kāmarūpa to Raghu. Thus all the four verses

<div n="lb"/>but reinstated in their kingdoms. Kāñcī is the same as Kāñcīpura
<div n="lb"/>or modern Conjeevaram in the Chingleput district of Madras
<div n="lb"/>Presidency.<sup>554</sup> The kingdom of Kāñcī extended from the mouth
<div n="lb"/>of the Krishna to the south of the river Palar and sometimes
<div n="lb"/>even to the Kaveri.<sup>555</sup> It is also known as Kāñcīpeḍu.<sup>556</sup> It is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in several early records relating to the ancient his-
<div n="lb"/>tory of the Pallavas of Kāñcī (of about A.D. 250 to 355)<sup>557</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Aihole inscription of Pulakeśin, the Cālukya ruler in the 7th
<div n="lb"/>century A.D. refers to his conquest of Kāñcīpura.<sup>558</sup> The ear-
<div n="lb"/>liest literary reference to Kāñcī is in the Mahābhāṣya of Patañ-
<div n="lb"/>jali.<sup>559</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Mahābhāṣya on Vārttika 26 to Pāṇini IV. 2. 104 men-
<div n="lb"/>tions Kāñcīpuraka (i. e. a resident of Kāñcīpura).<sup>560</sup> Hiuen
<div n="lb"/>Tsang informs us that Kāñcī was 30 li or 5 miles in circuit, and
<div n="lb"/>that in the city there were eighty Deva temples and many here-
<div n="lb"/>ties called Nirgranthas.<sup>561</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Purāṇas attach great importance to Kāñcī.<sup>562</sup> It is
<div n="lb"/>included in a list of seven holy cities of India.<sup>563</sup> The Brah-
<div n="lb"/>māṇḍa Purāṇa<sup>564</sup> associates Kāñcī with Kāśī, the two forming
<div n="lb"/>the two eyes of Śiva. It is stated in the Bārhaspatya sūtra<sup>565</sup>
<div n="lb"/>that Kāñcī is a Śākta-kṣetra. In the Devībhāgavata<sup>566</sup>, Kāñcī
<div n="lb"/>is said to be a sthāna of the Devī called Annapūrṇā.<sup>567</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Vāmana Purāṇa<sup>568</sup> mentions it as the best among the cities.
<div n="lb"/>The Skandapurāṇa<sup>569</sup> counts it amongst the holy places. The
<div n="lb"/>Bhāgavatapurāṇa<sup>570</sup> and the Yoginītantra<sup>571</sup> also mention it.
<div n="lb"/>In Daśakumāracaritam<sup>572</sup> it is referred to as a city of the Drāviḍa
<div n="lb"/>country.
<div n="P"/>Kāñcī is full of temples and shrines. Śiva Kāñcī and Viṣṇu
<div n="lb"/>Kāñcī form the western and eastern parts of the city, while
<div n="lb"/>the Jaina Kāñcī is known as Tiruparutti-Kunram.<sup>573</sup> Of the
<div n="lb"/>temples at Conjeevaram, the most famous are the Kāmākṣī
<div n="lb"/>temple with a Cakra placed in front of the deity, the Vaikuṇṭha
<div n="lb"/>Perumal temple of Viṣṇu and the Śhiva temple of Kailā-
<div n="lb"/>śanātha.<sup>574</sup>
<div n="P"/>Apart from its religious significance Kāñcī has been a
<div n="lb"/>famous centre of learning. The Pallava ruler Mahendravarman,
<div n="lb"/>the author of the Mattavilāsa-Prahasana; Bhāravi, the author
[Page-256+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>of the Kirātārjunīyam and Daṇḍin, the author of the Daśakumār-
<div n="lb"/>acaritam are said to have flourished here.<sup>575</sup>
<div n="P"/>The famous Buddhist dialectician Dinnāga came here to
<div n="lb"/>satisfy his intellectual and spiritual thirst and about the middle
<div n="lb"/>of the fourth century A.D., the brāhmaṇa Mayūraśaraman,
<div n="lb"/>who founded the Kadamba line came here for getting recogni-
<div n="lb"/>tion in Vedic learning.<sup>576</sup> The Ādi-guru Śaṅkarācārya establi-
<div n="lb"/>shed here the famous Pīṭha known as Kāmakotipīṭha.<sup>577</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Literally Kāñcī means a ‘girdle’. It seems to have been so
<div n="lb"/>named because it is situated like a girdle round the sea.

5. {%Kāśī%}¦ (No. 28, L. 6):
<div n="lb"/>It is mentioned in Inscription No. 28. According to the in-
<div n="lb"/>scription a vihāra at Vaṭa-gohālī was inhabited by the disciples
<div n="lb"/>of the Nigrantha preceptor (Śramaṇācārya) Guhanandin,
<div n="lb"/>belonging to the Pañca-stūpa section (nikāya) of Kāśī.<sup>578</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Evidently Vaṭagohālī was a seat of Jain monks who had their
<div n="lb"/>major seat at Kāśī.
<div n="P"/>The name Kāśī is derived from the root Kaś ‘to shine’.
<div n="lb"/>The Skandapurāṇa<sup>579</sup> says that the city of Kāśī became famous
<div n="lb"/>by that name because it sheds light on (the way to) nirvāṇa or
<div n="lb"/>because, that indescribable refulgence, viz. god Śiva shines
<div n="lb"/>forth here.<sup>580</sup> B.C. Law connects it with Ti-miao meaning ‘read
<div n="lb"/>sprouts’, a Chinese translation of the word and this links it
<div n="lb"/>with a certain kind of grass.<sup>581</sup> It has been known for centuries
<div n="lb"/>under five different names, viz., Vārāṇasī (modern Banaras),
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī, Avimukta, Ānandakānana and Śmaśāna or Mahāśma-
<div n="lb"/>śāna.<sup>582</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of the Kāśīs as a tribal people occurs
<div n="lb"/>in the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda.<sup>583</sup> Vārāṇasī
<div n="lb"/>was the capital of the people of Kāśī.<sup>584</sup> Thus it seems that
<div n="lb"/>geographically Kāśī represented a larger area than Vārāṇasī, the
<div n="lb"/>latter being the capital of the former. But in medieval times
<div n="lb"/>the position became just the reverse. Vārāṇasī comprehended
<div n="lb"/>the entire district and Kāśī generally represented only a small
<div n="lb"/>place. In a grant of Mahārāja Vināyakapāla we get a reference
<div n="lb"/>to a village of Tikkarikā situated in the Pratiṣṭhāna-bhukti,
<div n="lb"/>and attached to Kāśī-pāra-Pathaka which belonged to Vārāṇasī
<div n="lb"/>viṣaya.<sup>585</sup> Kāśī pāra-pathaka represented the site of the ancient
<div n="lb"/>city of the Kāśī.<sup>586</sup> The Vividhatīrthakalpa<sup>587</sup> also mentions
[Page-257+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī as a janapada in the Vārāṇasī City.
<div n="P"/>The ancient kingdom of Kāśī was bounded by Kośala on the
<div n="lb"/>north, Magadha on the east, and Vatsa on the west. The
<div n="lb"/>Cedis and Karuṣas lived to their south.<sup>588</sup> At the time of
<div n="lb"/>Buddha, the kingdom of Kāśī was absorbed by the kingdom of
<div n="lb"/>Kośala.<sup>589</sup>
<div n="P"/>We know that Lord Buddha gave his first discourse near
<div n="lb"/>Kāśī in the Deer Park at Sārnāth. Kāśī was an important
<div n="lb"/>Buddhist centre and was a seat of monastic establishments in
<div n="lb"/>the time of Aśoka.<sup>590</sup> During the period of Gupta rule it was
<div n="lb"/>on its way to become a strong centre of Śiva worship with the
<div n="lb"/>mahāliṅgas set up in different parts of the city.<sup>591</sup> The Purāṇas
<div n="lb"/>include the region in the Gupta empire.<sup>592</sup>
<div n="P"/>It was a great centre of trade and commerce. Patañjali in
<div n="lb"/>his Mahābhāṣya<sup>593</sup> mentions Kāśī cloth. The Buddhist litera-
<div n="lb"/>ture gives us many accounts of the merchants of the city.<sup>594</sup>
<div n="P"/>Kāśī has been a place of much improtance for Hindu pil-
<div n="lb"/>grimage. Its religious importance has been discussed at length
<div n="lb"/>in the Kāśīkhaṇḍa of the Skanda Purāṇa. Lord Śiva never
<div n="lb"/>leaves it, hence it is known as Avimukta. A man who dies here
<div n="lb"/>is believed to get emancipation.<sup>595</sup>

<div n="lb"/>sibilant. It is included in the list of the Dakṣiṇāpatha kingdoms
<div n="lb"/>whose kings were conquered but reinstated by Samudragupta.
<div n="lb"/>At that time Mahendra was its ruler. It has been identified
<div n="lb"/>with South Kosala corresponding to modern district of Raipur,
<div n="lb"/>Sambalpur and Bilaspur of M.P. and Orissa.<sup>596</sup> Its old capital
<div n="lb"/>was Śrīpura (modern Sirpur), 40 miles north-east of Raipur.<sup>597</sup> It
<div n="lb"/>is the same as Mahā-kosala<sup>598</sup> which forms the largest unit among
<div n="lb"/>the three component parts of the State of Madhya Pradesh.<sup>599</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The recent excavation at Eraṇ has thrown a flood of new light
<div n="lb"/>on the early history of eastern Malwa and Mahākosala between
<div n="lb"/>the period 1900 B.C. and A.D. 600. During the Gupta period
<div n="lb"/>several Brahmanical temples were built in this region. In the
<div n="lb"/>early medieval period i. e. from A.D. 600 to 1200, the Candellas
<div n="lb"/>and Kalacuris were the two chief ruling dynasties in the
<div n="lb"/>Mahākosala area. In the period of Muslim rule followed by
<div n="lb"/>Maratha supremacy, many forts and fortresses were built
[Page-258+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>by the ruling chiefs<sup>600</sup> in different parts of Mahākosala.
<div n="lb"/>Dakṣiṇa Kosala is mentioned in the Ratnāvalī (Act IV) as
<div n="lb"/>having been conquered by Udayana, king of Vatsa.<sup>601</sup>
<div n="P"/>N.L. Dey<sup>602</sup> identifies Dakṣiṇa Kosala with Tosalī of
<div n="lb"/>Aśoka's inscription (Tosala) at Dhauli, which is situated near
<div n="lb"/>Bhuvaneśwar in the Puri district, Orissa. Sylvain Levi suggests
<div n="lb"/>an Austric origin for this wold. ‘Kosala changing to Tosala is
<div n="lb"/>an apparent variation of the initial due to the formative
<div n="lb"/>prefix’<sup>603</sup> in the Austric languages. The country of Tosala also,
<div n="lb"/>like Kosala, had two divisions: Uttara Tosala and Dakṣiṇa
<div n="lb"/>Tosala.<sup>604</sup> Dakṣiṇa Tosala consisted of a maṇḍala of the name
<div n="lb"/>of Koṅgoda. In some cases by mistake the reading Dakṣiṇa
<div n="lb"/>kosala is given in place of Dakṣiṇa Tosala.<sup>605</sup> But it is clear
<div n="lb"/>from other evidence that Tosala and Kosala were two separate
<div n="lb"/>entities. The purāṇas mention them separately.<sup>606</sup> The Kāvya-
<div n="lb"/>mīmāṃṣā also makes a separate reference to the two.<sup>607</sup>

[Page-261+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>his imperious commands.<sup>647</sup> Samataṭa is the only territory in

<div n="lb"/>‘an area of land requiring one kulya measure of seed grains
<div n="lb"/>to be sown’.<sup>673</sup> This land measure differed in different ages and
<div n="lb"/>localities. Maity<sup>674</sup> gives this area of five kulyavāpas in terms
<div n="lb"/>of modern measurements as follows:
<div n="P"/>5 kulyavāpas = 1 pāṭaka = 192-240 bighās = 72-88 acres
<div n="lb"/>and believes the lower figures to be more correct.

<div n="lb"/>It seems to be the name of a locality. The metathesis of two

<div n="lb"/>Sanskrit form should have been ‘Parapastikā’. The word

<L>464<pc>263<k1>AryAvartta<k2>AryAvartta
1. {%Āryāvartta%}¦ (No. 1, L. 12):
<div n="lb"/>Samudragupta is stated to have violently exterminated many
<div n="lb"/>kings of Āryāvarta such as Rudradeva, Matila, Nāgadatta,
<div n="lb"/>Candravarman, Gaṇapatināga, Nāgasena, Acyuta, Nandin
<div n="lb"/>and Balavarman.<sup>677</sup> We also find references to Āryāvarta in
<div n="lb"/>other epigraphic records.<sup>678</sup>
<div n="P"/>Literally Āryāvarta<sup>679</sup> means ‘the abode of the Āryas, or
<div n="lb"/>excellent or noble people’. The word ‘Ārya’ here is significant.
<div n="P"/>It has been interpreted in two ways: some scholars derive
<div n="lb"/>the word Ārya from the root §{%Ar,%} to plough, and suggest that
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic Āryans were so called because they despised the
<div n="lb"/>pursuits of agriculture and remained shepherds and hunters.<sup>680</sup>
<div n="P"/>“If {%Ārya%} were purely a racial term. a more probable deri-
<div n="lb"/>vation would be {%Ar,%} meaning strength or valour, from §ar
<div n="lb"/>to fight, whence we have the name of the Greek war-god Ares,
<div n="lb"/>areios, brave or warlike, perhaps even arete, virtue signifying,
<div n="lb"/>like the Latin virtues, first physical strength and courage and
<div n="lb"/>then moral force and elevation”.<sup>681</sup> “Intrinsically, in its most
<div n="lb"/>fundamental sense, Ārya means an effort or an uprising or
<div n="lb"/>overcoming. The Āryan is he who strives and overcomes all
<div n="lb"/>outside him and within him that stands opposed to the human
<div n="lb"/>advance.”<sup>682</sup> Wilson says that a variety of ancient designations
<div n="lb"/>of which ‘Āria’ is a component element (cf. Ariāna) are con-
<div n="lb"/>nected with the term Ārya. The Zend name for the country
<div n="lb"/>to the west of the Indus was ‘Eriene-veejo’, that is the Sans-
<div n="lb"/>krit Āryāvarta.<sup>683</sup>
<div n="P"/>In defining the boundaries of Āryāvarta, Vasiṣṭha and
<div n="lb"/>Baudhāyana in their Dharmasūtras lay stress on the word
<div n="lb"/>Ārya and explain it to mean {%śiṣṭa.%} Patañjali also in his Mahā-
[Page-264+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>bhāṣya first explains the meaning of {%śiṣṭa%} in order to draw
<div n="lb"/>attention to the cultural basis of the name Āryāvarta. He
<div n="lb"/>remarks that correct conduct is found in Āryāvarta and then
<div n="lb"/>mentions its boundaries.<sup>684</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Brāhmaṇa period the centre of Āryan culture and ci-
<div n="lb"/>vilization shifted to the Gangetic Doab “Āryāvarta came to be
<div n="lb"/>treated as conterminous with the region between the Gaṅgā
<div n="lb"/>and Yamunā.<sup>685</sup> In the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>686</sup> special honour
<div n="lb"/>is assigned to those who dwell between the Gaṅgā and the
<div n="lb"/>Yamunā. In the Śutra period Āryāvarta extended from the
<div n="lb"/>hills of Central Rajasthan to the hills of Central Bihar.<sup>687</sup>
<div n="P"/>At the time of Patañjali,<sup>688</sup> Āryāvarta was bounded on the
<div n="lb"/>north by the Himalayas, on the south by Pāriyātraka, on the
<div n="lb"/>west by Ādarśāvalī and on the east by Kālakavana (Rajmahal
<div n="lb"/>hills) ‘Black Forest’ or rather Kanakhala, near Hardwar.<sup>689</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus it seems that Āryāvarta bore a sacerdotal sense and
<div n="lb"/>denoted a particularly limited area where Āryan institutions
<div n="lb"/>were the basis of social order.<sup>690</sup>
<div n="P"/>What was originally called Āryāvarta was later named as
<div n="lb"/>Madhya-deśa and Āryāvarta came to include the whole of
<div n="lb"/>Northern India. This is related to the gradual spread of Ārya-
<div n="lb"/>nism.<sup>691</sup> Brahmāvarta and Brahmarṣideśa lost their identity in
<div n="lb"/>the Madhya-deśa and combined with Prācya, Pratīcya and
<div n="lb"/>Udīcya (Uttarāpatha) became the equivalent of Āryāvarta.<sup>692</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Both Udīcya and Prācya were taken as the home (loka) of
<div n="lb"/>standard Sanskrit both in Pāṇini's time and earlier. In the time
<div n="lb"/>of Patañjali, Āryāvarta came to be regarded as the home of the
<div n="lb"/>Śiṣṭas (persons proficient in the Śāstras) whose language set the
<div n="lb"/>norm.<sup>693</sup>
<div n="P"/>By the second century A.D., the last limit of the composi-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the Manu-smṛti, the wider outlook of Āryāvarta was
<div n="lb"/>popular. It was the name of the tract extending from the
<div n="lb"/>Eastern to the Western Ocean, and bounded on the north and
<div n="lb"/>south by the Himalaya and Vindhya respectively.<sup>694</sup> This is
<div n="lb"/>supported by the Kāvyamīmāṃsā of Rājaśekhara.<sup>695</sup> Rājaśek-
<div n="lb"/>hara speaks of the river Narmadā as the dividing line between
<div n="lb"/>Āryāvarta and the Dakṣiṇāpatha.<sup>696</sup> In Inscription No. 1, L. 29
<div n="lb"/>Āryāvarta is contrasted with Dakṣiṇāpatha, ‘the southern
<div n="lb"/>region’.<sup>697</sup> The wider sense of Āryāvarta is also supported by
[Page-265+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>references in the Abhidhāna-cintāmaṇi<sup>698</sup> and the Rājataraṅ-
<div n="lb"/>giṇī.<sup>699</sup>

2. {%Kākanādaboṭa%}¦ (No. 5, L. 1; No. 23, L. 2):
<div n="lb"/>In both the inscriptions, we find reference to a grant to the
<div n="lb"/>Ārya Saṃgha or the Community of the faithful, at the great
<div n="lb"/>Vihāra, or Buddhist convent of Kākanādaboṭa,<sup>700</sup> for the
<div n="lb"/>purpose of feeding mendicants and maintaining lamps.
<div n="P"/>D.C. Sircar takes ‘Kākanādaboṭa’ to be the old name of
<div n="lb"/>Sāñcī.<sup>701</sup> Fleet is of the view that the Kākanādaboṭa convent
<div n="lb"/>is the Great Stūpa itself. According to him the word Boṭa is
<div n="lb"/>another form of Poṭa which means ‘the foundation of a
<div n="lb"/>house’.<sup>702</sup> Fleet further writes that the name ‘Kākanāda’ lit.
<div n="lb"/>‘the noise of the crow’ was the ancient name of Sāñcī itself
<div n="lb"/>which is proved by its occurrence in two inscriptions in Mauryan
<div n="lb"/>characters found at Sāñcī.<sup>703</sup>
<div n="P"/>Thus, it is clear that Kākanāda was the ancient name of
<div n="lb"/>Sāñcī in the Bhopal State, now Raisen district, Madhya
<div n="lb"/>Pradesh, well-known for its Buddhist topes.<sup>704</sup> The word ‘boṭa’
<div n="lb"/>is thus a surplus and joined by ‘Kākanāda’ will refer to the
<div n="lb"/>great stūpa itself. Its form Poṭa meaning the foundation of a
<div n="lb"/>house is untenable because the word ‘vihāra’ in that very sense
<div n="lb"/>appears in the inscriptions. The word ‘boṭa’ has been used here
<div n="lb"/>in the sense of an ascetic cult.<sup>705</sup> It is a Prakrit word which has
<div n="lb"/>been used here to refer to ‘the Buddhist cult’. Thus the relevant
<div n="lb"/>expression means ‘in the holy great vihāra of the Buddhist cult
<div n="lb"/>(assembly) at Kākanāda’.
<div n="P"/>Fleet is wrong in translating the word Kākanāda to mean
<div n="lb"/>‘the noise of the crow’.<sup>706</sup> K.P. Jayaswal's rendering ‘the praise
<div n="lb"/>of the Kākas’<sup>707</sup> is more to the point. We know of the Kākas,
<div n="lb"/>an autonomous community mentioned in the Allahabad In-
<div n="lb"/>scription of Samudragupta.<sup>708</sup> In Eastern Malwa we have two
<div n="lb"/>ancient place-names connected with the Kākas. One is the hill
<div n="lb"/>now called Sāñcī hill (the ancient) Kākanāda. The other is an
<div n="lb"/>ancient village called Kāka-pura, some 20 miles north of
<div n="lb"/>Bhilsa, and full of ancient monuments.<sup>709</sup>

3. {%Uttara Kuru%}¦ (No. 22, L. 7):
<div n="lb"/>A person named Śaṃkara is described in the inscription as
<div n="lb"/>born in the region of the north, the best of countries, which
<div n="lb"/>resembles (in beautitude) the land of the Northern Kurus.<sup>710</sup>
[Page-266+ 39]
<div n="P"/>The Kurus had two branches, the northern and the southern.
<div n="lb"/>Uttarakuru or the country of the Northern Kurus, is supposed
<div n="lb"/>to be a region beyond the most northern range of the Himālaya
<div n="lb"/>mountains, and is described as a country of everlasing hap-
<div n="lb"/>piness.<sup>711</sup> We have discussed in details, the Kurus, in the
<div n="lb"/>section on tribes. The Bṛhatsaṃhitā<sup>712</sup> mentions it as a country
<div n="lb"/>situated in the North. In the later period the Uttarakurus had
<div n="lb"/>only a mythical or legendary existence.

<L>467<pc>266<k1>vaNga<k2>vaNga
4. {%Vaṅga%}¦ (No. 20, L. I):
<div n="lb"/>In this inscription, king Candra, “on whose arm fame was
<div n="lb"/>inscribed by the sword, when in battle in Vaṅga countries, is
<div n="lb"/>stated to have kneaded, back with his breast the enemies who,
<div n="lb"/>uniting together, came against him”.<sup>713</sup> This is taken by
<div n="lb"/>scholars<sup>714</sup> to be the first epigraphic mention of Vaṅga. The
<div n="lb"/>Vaṅgas here mean the ‘Vaṅga country’ the eastern Bengal of
<div n="lb"/>modern times. Bajpai is of the opinion that the Vaṅgas
<div n="lb"/>of the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription of Candra (No. 20) are the
<div n="lb"/>people living in the Makaran coast of Baluchistan.<sup>715</sup> But the
<div n="lb"/>Vaṅgas here denote country and not the people. Moreover, the
<div n="lb"/>victory of king Candra over the Vaṅga countries has no con-
<div n="lb"/>nection with his conquest of the Vāhlikas. Both are separately
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in his campaign. In Sanskrit the tribal name in the
<div n="lb"/>plural is regularly used to indicate the country inhabited by the
<div n="lb"/>tribe.<sup>716</sup> The Vaṅga countries are also referred to in the
<div n="lb"/>Mahākūṭa Pillar Inscription,<sup>717</sup> but in the inscriptions after
<div n="lb"/>the 9th century A.D. the word Vaṅgāla is usually mention-
<div n="lb"/>ed.<sup>718</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of the Vaṅgas along with the Magadhas
<div n="lb"/>is in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.<sup>719</sup> The name is also found in the
<div n="lb"/>Baudhāyana Dharma-Sūtra<sup>720</sup> where the Vaṅgas are mentioned
<div n="lb"/>as impure people.<sup>721</sup> But the Drama ‘Pratijñā-Yaugandha-
<div n="lb"/>rāyaṇa’ (Act II), ascribed to Bhāsa and probably not older
<div n="lb"/>than the 4th century A.D., suggests that the ruling families of
<div n="lb"/>Bengal were regarded as equals to those of Northern India for
<div n="lb"/>intermarriage with the royal family of Mālava.<sup>722</sup>
<div n="P"/>The people of Vaṅga are stated to have fought in the Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>kshetra war<sup>723</sup> and, in course of his expedition Bhīṣma is said
<div n="lb"/>to have defeated Samudrasena of Vaṅga.<sup>724</sup> The Kāśikā men-
<div n="lb"/>tions Vāṅgaka to explain Pāṇini's sūtra (IV. 3. 100) denoting
[Page-267+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>loyalty of the citizen to the state.<sup>725</sup> Pāṇini mentions Vāṅgī
<div n="lb"/>(the lady of Vaṅga Janapada) along with Avantī, Kurū and
<div n="lb"/>Yaudheyī.<sup>726</sup> Patañjali also refers to the Vaṅgas by way of
<div n="lb"/>illustration.<sup>727</sup> Kauṭilya makes similar references to the
<div n="lb"/>country.<sup>728</sup> The Bhāgavata Purāṇa also mentions it as a
<div n="lb"/>country.<sup>729</sup> Kālidāsa states that Raghu after conquering the
<div n="lb"/>Sumhas,<sup>730</sup> defeated the Vaṅgas with his force.<sup>731</sup> The Kāvya-
<div n="lb"/>mīmāṃsā mentions Vaṅga as a janapada situated in the east.<sup>732</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The Bṛhatsaṃhitā also mentions it in the east along with Upa-
<div n="lb"/>Vaṅga.<sup>733</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to the Mahābhārata<sup>734</sup> Vaṅga, son of Bali, had
<div n="lb"/>establishad this country. The Amarakośa<sup>735</sup> mentions Vaṅga
<div n="lb"/>as a synonym of Raṅga (lead), but lead is not available
<div n="lb"/>in Bengal and is found in abundance in Malaya, Pegu and
<div n="lb"/>East Indies. People in other parts of India may have received
<div n="lb"/>lead through the people of East Bengal. Suśruta also uses
<div n="lb"/>Vaṅga in the same sense as Amara does<sup>736</sup>
<div n="P"/>R.C. Banerji<sup>737</sup>, on the basis of the Ablur Inscription of the
<div n="lb"/>Kalacuri king Bijjala<sup>738</sup> takes Vaṅga and Vaṅgāla as two dis-
<div n="lb"/>tinct people or tribes. This view has been correctly refuted by
<div n="lb"/>S.B. Chaudhuri<sup>739</sup> who concludes that Vaṅgāla was within Vaṅga
<div n="lb"/>and hence was not altogether a separate geographical entity
<div n="lb"/>as is maintained by some.
<div n="P"/>The confusion may be due to the fact that the geographi-
<div n="lb"/>cal location of the Vaṅga country changed in different periods.
<div n="lb"/>The same country Vaṅga was known as Vaṅgāla with the addi-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the Prakrit suffix {%‘āla’%}<sup>740</sup> which was transliterated by the
<div n="lb"/>Muslims as Bangālah (pronouncing Bangāla) in their script<sup>741</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and this was changed into Bengal by the English people.
<div n="P"/>The Yādavaprakāśa equates Vaṅga with Harikeli<sup>742</sup> but
<div n="lb"/>the Kalpadrukośa, a work of the seventeenth century states that
<div n="lb"/>Śrīhaṭṭa is Harikeli.<sup>743</sup> The commentary of Yaśodhara on the
<div n="lb"/>Kāmasūtra refers to Vaṅga as situated to the east of the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmaputra.<sup>744</sup>

1. {%Gaṅgā%}¦ (No. 1, L. 31, No. 13, L. 16):
<div n="lb"/>In Inscription No. 1 Samudragupta's fame has been compared
<div n="lb"/>with the pale yellow water of the river Gaṅgā, which travelling
<div n="lb"/>by many paths, purifies the three worlds, flowing quickly on
<div n="lb"/>being liberated from confinement in the thickets of the matted
<div n="lb"/>hair of (the) god Paśupati.<sup>1</sup> In the Mandasor inscription of
<div n="lb"/>Yaśodharman and Viṣṇuvardhana<sup>2</sup> it is stated that when the
<div n="lb"/>river Gaṅgā was about to descend from heaven to earth, in
<div n="lb"/>order to break the force of its fall, god Śiva (Paśupati) received
<div n="lb"/>it in the matted hair coiled above his forehead and projecting
<div n="lb"/>like a horn; its waters wandered there for a thousand years,
<div n="lb"/>before they eventually reached the earth.
<div n="P"/>In Inscription No. 13, we get a reference to Gaṅgā in the
<div n="lb"/>context of Skandagupta's fight with the Hūṇas, the noise of
<div n="lb"/>which was heard like the roaring of (the river) Gaṅgā, making
<div n="lb"/>itself noticed in their ears.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>A.C. Woolner<sup>4</sup> remarked that the name Gaṅgā does not
<div n="lb"/>seem to have a convincing derivation on the Āryan side. But
<div n="lb"/>we do find the word in the Uṇādi affixes. The affix Gan
<div n="lb"/>comes after the root Gaṃ ‘to go’ and the word Gaṅgā is
<div n="lb"/>formed.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>The earliest mention of Gaṅgā is in the Ṛgveda.<sup>6</sup> The name
<div n="lb"/>also occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> and the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Āraṇyaka.<sup>8</sup> We find it also in Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya,<sup>9</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>in Kālidāsa's Raghuvaṃśa.<sup>10</sup> It is mentioned many times in
<div n="lb"/>the Purāṇas<sup>11</sup> in which a good deal of religious importance is
<div n="lb"/>attached to it.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Gaṅgā emerges first in the Gangotri in the district of
[Page-294+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Garhwal and proceeds in different courses from Hardwar to
<div n="lb"/>Bulandshahar and from Allahabad to Rajmahal from where it
<div n="lb"/>enters Bengal.<sup>13</sup>

<div n="lb"/>here that the word Gaṅga is to be taken in the sense of a

<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā.<sup>16</sup> We also know of a Jambūnadī as a vīthī in the Gayā

<div n="lb"/>According to the inscription in the reign of Budhagupta, his
<div n="lb"/>feudatory, Mahārāja Suraśmicandra was governing the country
<div n="lb"/>lying between the river Kālindī and Narmadā.<sup>18</sup> Kālindī is
<div n="lb"/>the same as the river Yamunā.<sup>19</sup> The Yamunā has got its
<div n="lb"/>source from the Kalindadeśa, a mountainous country situated
<div n="lb"/>in the Bāndarapuccha range or the Himālaya and hence the
<div n="lb"/>river is called Kālindī.<sup>20</sup> In the Purāṇas we get the earlier
<div n="lb"/>mention of Kālindī by both the names, Kālindī as well as
<div n="lb"/>Yamunā.<sup>21</sup> The Kālindī is also mentioned in the Śiśupālavadha
<div n="lb"/>of Māga.<sup>22</sup>

<L>472<pc>294<k1>narmadA<k2>narmadA
5. {%Narmadā%}¦ (No. 18, L. 3):
<div n="lb"/>The above-mentioned inscription describes reign of Mahārāja
<div n="lb"/>Suraśmicandra, a feudatory of Budhagupta, as governing over
<div n="lb"/>the area between the rivers Kālindī and Narmadā.<sup>23</sup> This is
<div n="lb"/>one of the earliest inscriptional references to the river Nar-
<div n="lb"/>madā.<sup>24</sup> It is mentioned as Narmados by Ptolemy.<sup>25</sup> No ex-
<div n="lb"/>press reference to the Narmadā can be traced in the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature. But the knowledge of the river is implied in the
<div n="lb"/>reference to a chief Revottaras mentioned in the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa.<sup>26</sup> We find from the Amarakośa<sup>27</sup> that Revā is
<div n="lb"/>another name of the river Narmadā. It is likely that the
<div n="lb"/>name of the chief was derived from his association with the
<div n="lb"/>river.<sup>28</sup> The Raghuvaṃśa speaks of Mahiṣmatī as the capital
<div n="lb"/>of Anūpa on the bank of the Revā (i. e. Narmadā).<sup>29</sup> It has
<div n="lb"/>been mentioned several times in the Mahābhārata and the
[Page-295+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Purāṇas.<sup>30</sup> The Viṣṇupurāṇa says that by chanting a mantra
<div n="lb"/>addressed to the Narmadā, one does not have any fear from
<div n="lb"/>serpents.<sup>31</sup> The river rises in the Amarakaṇṭaka mountain and
<div n="lb"/>falls into the Gulf of Cambay. The junction of the Narmadā
<div n="lb"/>with the sea is a sacred place of pilgrimage.<sup>32</sup> According to
<div n="lb"/>the Purāṇas it flows from a Ṛkṣvat (a part of the Vindhyan
<div n="lb"/>range) though some of them refer to it arising directly from
<div n="lb"/>the Vindhya itself.<sup>33</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is stated in the Kūrma and Matsya Purāṇas that a man
<div n="lb"/>who commits suicide at any tīrtha on the Narmadā or on the
<div n="lb"/>Amarakaṇṭaka does not return to this world.<sup>34</sup> Several rivers
<div n="lb"/>such as Kapilā, Viśalyā, Eraṇḍī, Ikṣunadī and Kāverī<sup>35</sup> are
<div n="lb"/>mentioned as falling into the Narmadā.

<div n="lb"/>The inscription No. 16 refers to a brāhmaṇa named Devaviṣṇu,
<div n="lb"/>who belonged to the community of Caturvedins of Padmā of
<div n="lb"/>the town of Indrapura.<sup>36</sup> The Gaṅgā is also known as Padmā
<div n="lb"/>or Paddā.<sup>37</sup> The community of the brāhmaṇas mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>the inscription might have lived by the side of the river.
<div n="lb"/>D.C. Sircar takes Padmā to be the name of a locality in the
<div n="lb"/>town of Indrapura.<sup>38</sup> The inscription (No. 16) also tells us
<div n="lb"/>that Skandagupta's feudatory viṣayapati Śarvanāga was govern-
<div n="lb"/>ing Antarvedi or the country lying between the Gaṅgā and the
<div n="lb"/>Yamunā.<sup>39</sup>

<div n="lb"/>This river Palāśinī issues from the mountain Raivataka. On
<div n="lb"/>account of the flood it had swollen. The poet, in describing
<div n="lb"/>the scene says that the river had gone to join the sea. Palāśinī
<div n="lb"/>is described as emanating from the mountain Ūrjayat (i. e. the
<div n="lb"/>same as Raivataka).<sup>41</sup> We find another Palāśinī, (mod. Parās),
<div n="lb"/>a tributary of the Koel in Choṭānagpur.<sup>42</sup> It seems that the
<div n="lb"/>river was decorated with numerous Palāśa (flower) trees that
<div n="lb"/>grew on its banks. The flowers falling in the river must have
<div n="lb"/>given it the name of Palāśinī.<sup>43</sup>

<div n="lb"/>It is the same as Suvarṇa-sikatā mentioned in the Junāgaṛh
<div n="lb"/>Rock Inscription of Rudradāman.<sup>45</sup> This Sikatā or Suvarṇasi-
<div n="lb"/>katā is to be identified with modern Soṇarekhā.<sup>46</sup> The name
[Page-296+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>Suvaṇṇarehā (Suvarṇarekhā) is also met with in Vividhatīr-
<div n="lb"/>thakalpa.<sup>47</sup> Thus the first part of the river's name has remained
<div n="lb"/>unchanged for about two thousand years. The second part has
<div n="lb"/>been replaced by a new one. The exact derivative as suggested
<div n="lb"/>by Chatterji will be a form like Sonasītā or Sonasī.<sup>48</sup> The river
<div n="lb"/>was named Suvarṇasikatā because its sand contains particles of
<div n="lb"/>gold.<sup>49</sup>

9. {%Sindhu%}¦ (No. 20, L. 2):
<div n="lb"/>The river is mentioned in connexion with the description of
<div n="lb"/>the victories of king Candra who is said to have conquered the
<div n="lb"/>Vāhlikas after having crossed the seven mouths of the (river)
<div n="lb"/>Sindhu<sup>50</sup> in warfare. Sindhu in the Ṛgveda<sup>51</sup> and the Athar-
<div n="lb"/>vaveda<sup>52</sup> often means simply a ‘stream’. The Ṛgveda (VIII.
<div n="lb"/>24. 27) refers to ‘Sapta Sindhavaḥ’ or ‘the seven rivers’.<sup>53</sup> But
<div n="lb"/>it is also<sup>54</sup> used in the more exact sense of the ‘stream’ par
<div n="lb"/>excellence or ‘The Indus’. We get a reference to Sindhu as a
<div n="lb"/>river in the Amara-kośa.<sup>55</sup> The territories adjoining it were
<div n="lb"/>famous for horses<sup>56</sup> and salt.<sup>57</sup>
<div n="P"/>The term Sindhu was corrupted to Hindu in the old Per-
<div n="lb"/>sian inscriptions of Darius I (516-485 B.C.), and to Indus by
<div n="lb"/>the Ionian (= Pāṇini's Yavana) Greeks.<sup>58</sup> The word ‘India’ is
<div n="lb"/>derived from the river Sindhu or the Indus.<sup>59</sup> Taking its rise
<div n="lb"/>from the snows of Western Kailāśa in Tibet, the Sindhu first
<div n="lb"/>flows north-west of Kashmir and South of little Pamir, and
<div n="lb"/>then takes a southward course along which lay some of the
<div n="lb"/>important cities of north India. Emerging from the Darad
<div n="lb"/>high-lands, the river (Dāradī Sindhuḥ) enters the Gandhāra
<div n="lb"/>country until it receives its most important western tributary
<div n="lb"/>the Kabul river at Ohind, a few miles north of Attock.<sup>60</sup>
<div n="P"/>The river Sindhu is mentioned in the Purāṇas along with
<div n="lb"/>the Gaṅgā, Sarasvatī, Satluj, Chinab and Yamunā.<sup>61</sup>
<div n="P"/>Vogel suggests that the expression ‘Sindhor sapta mukhāni’
<div n="lb"/>may indicate the ‘sapta sindhavaḥ’ of the Ṛgveda, i. e. the
<div n="lb"/>river Indus and its tributaries. The term mukha would then
<div n="lb"/>be not taken in the sense of ‘the mouth of a river’, but as
<div n="lb"/>meaning a river-head.<sup>62</sup> But the translation of the expression
<div n="lb"/>as done by Fleet (i. e. the seven mouths of the river Indus) is
<div n="lb"/>generally accepted.<sup>63</sup> The seven mouths of the river Indus
<div n="lb"/>thus represent the points of its confluence with its tributaries
[Page-297+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>and not the tributaries individually as suggested by Vogel.

<div n="lb"/>It is the name of a lake situated at some distance from
<div n="lb"/>Girinagara as mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of
<div n="lb"/>Rudradāman I (A.D. 150).<sup>64</sup> The lake was originally cons-
<div n="lb"/>tructed by the Vaiśya Puṣyagupta, the provincial governor of
<div n="lb"/>the Maurya king Candragupta. Later on during the reign of
<div n="lb"/>Aśoka it was adorned with conduits, by the Yavana governor
<div n="lb"/>Tuṣāspha.<sup>65</sup> The same lake was destroyed by the excessive
<div n="lb"/>floods in the Suvarṇasikatā, Palāśinī and other streams arising
<div n="lb"/>from the mountain Ūrjayat.<sup>66</sup> By a breach, four hundred and
<div n="lb"/>twenty cubits long, just as much broad, (and) seventy-five
<div n="lb"/>cubits deep, all the water flowed out, so that, the lake, almost
<div n="lb"/>like a sandy desert became extremely ugly to look at.<sup>67</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>lake was immediately beatufied with repairs by king Rudradā-
<div n="lb"/>man.<sup>68</sup>
<div n="P"/>Inscription No. 14 informs us that during the reign of
<div n="lb"/>Gupta king Skandagupta in the year 136 (G. E.), due to heavy
<div n="lb"/>continous rains the Sudarśana lake burst out on all sides<sup>69</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and had the appearance of a sea. Eventually, contrary to the
<div n="lb"/>literal meaning of its name the Sudarśana became ugly to look
<div n="lb"/>at.<sup>70</sup> The lake was reparied in the year 137 (G. E.)<sup>71</sup> (= A.D.
<div n="lb"/>456) by Cakrapālita, who was appointed governor of Giri-
<div n="lb"/>nagara by his father Parṇadatta, who was Skandagupta's

<div n="lb"/>In L. 6 of the inscription the poet while giving an account of
<div n="lb"/>the city of Daśapura describes its buildings as lofty like the
<div n="lb"/>mountain Kailāśa itself.<sup>77</sup> L. 13 describes the mountain Kāilaśa
<div n="lb"/>as one of the breasts of the earth (the other being Sumeru) which
<div n="lb"/>was being reigned over by the Gupta king Kumāragupta.<sup>78</sup>
<div n="P"/>Kailāśa mountain is situated about 25 miles to the north of
<div n="lb"/>Māna-sarovara beyond Gangrī and to the east of the Niti
<div n="lb"/>Pass.<sup>79</sup> The Mahābhārata<sup>80</sup> includes the Kumaun and Garhwal
<div n="lb"/>mountains in the Kailāśa range. The mountain also known
<div n="lb"/>as Hemakūṭa, Śaṃkaragiri and is to be identified with the
<div n="lb"/>Aṣṭapada mountain of the Jainas.<sup>81</sup> It surpasses in beauty the
<div n="lb"/>big Gurlā or any other of the Indian Himālaya.<sup>82</sup> Traditionally
<div n="lb"/>it is supposed to be the habitat of Śiva and Pārvatī.<sup>83</sup>

2. {%Raivataka%}¦ (No. 14, L. 16) (the same as Ūrajayat see
<div n="lb"/>Ūrjayat):
<div n="lb"/>Raivataka is also mentioned in the Ādi-Parvan of the Mahā-
<div n="lb"/>bhārata,<sup>84</sup> the Vividhatīrthakalpa,<sup>85</sup> the Bṛhatsaṃhitā,<sup>86</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>Dohad Stone Inscription of Mahamūda,<sup>87</sup> and the Jaunpur In-
<div n="lb"/>scription of Iśānavarman.<sup>88</sup> Its modern name Girnar was a
<div n="lb"/>switch over to it from the city name Girinagara, i. e., ‘a city
<div n="lb"/>on or at the foot of a hill’.<sup>89</sup> Raivataka derives its name
<div n="lb"/>from king Revatā, the father of Revatī, (the wife of Baladeva,
<div n="lb"/>Kṛṣṇa's elder brother).<sup>90</sup> Revata is supposed to have come
<div n="lb"/>there from Dwārakā and lived on the hill. There is still a
<div n="lb"/>tank called Revatī-kuṇḍa near Dāmodarakuṇḍa in the gorge
<div n="lb"/>of the hill.<sup>91</sup> The Gujarati Sanskrit poet Māgha in the Śiśu-
<div n="lb"/>pālavadha devotes the whole of Canto IV (verses 1-68) to the
<div n="lb"/>description of the Raivataka mountain. In Canto VI (verses
<div n="lb"/>1-79) the poet describes the occurrence of six seasons one by
<div n="lb"/>one at the mountain Raivataka.

3. {%Sumeru%}¦ (No. 17, L. 13, No. 32, L. 15):
<div n="lb"/>In No. 17 the mountain Sumeru is described as one of the
<div n="lb"/>breasts of the earth (the other being Kailāśa) and the Gupta
[Page-299+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>king Kumāragupta is mentioned as the lord of the earth. In
<div n="lb"/>No. 32 it has been named as Amarabhūdhara. Its other names
<div n="lb"/>are Meru, Karṇikācala, Ratnasānu, Svargiri, Svargigiri and
<div n="lb"/>Kāñcanagiri.<sup>92</sup>
<div n="P"/>Sumeru is identified with Rudra Himālaya in Garhwal,
<div n="lb"/>where the river Gaṅgā has its source, it is near Badarikāśrama.<sup>93</sup>
<div n="lb"/>According to the Matsya Purāṇa<sup>94</sup> the Sumeru Parvata is
<div n="lb"/>bounded on the north by Uttara-Kuru, on the South by
<div n="lb"/>Bhāratavarṣa, on the west by Ketumāla and on the east by
<div n="lb"/>Bhadrāśvavarṣa.<sup>95</sup> It is also mentioned in the Padmapurāṇa.<sup>96</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the Kālikāpurāṇa.<sup>97</sup> According to the Kālikāpurāṇa Śiva saw
<div n="lb"/>the summit of it. We also learn from this text that the Jambu
<div n="lb"/>river flows from this mountain.<sup>98</sup> We also find the mention of
<div n="lb"/>the Meru in the Śiśupālavadha of Māgha. It was on account
<div n="lb"/>of the eminence of Sumeru among the mountains that for
<div n="lb"/>praising kings they were described as ‘Meru’ among kings.<sup>99</sup>
<div n="lb"/>This metaphor may have been applied after the contention of
<div n="lb"/>the Purāṇas that the earth is supposed to be like lotus, with
<div n="lb"/>four Mahādvīpas as its four petals and mount Meru as its
<div n="lb"/>pericarp.<sup>100</sup>

<L>483<pc>299<k1>Urjayat<k2>Urjayat
4. {%Ūrjayat%}¦ (No. 14, L. 16):
<div n="lb"/>The poet here draws a picture: the lake Sudarśana looked
<div n="lb"/>like the sea<sup>101</sup> and the rivers Palāśinī, (Suvarṇasikatā), etc.,
<div n="lb"/>had joined it has if the mountain Ūrjayat had stretched his
<div n="lb"/>hand with flowers (growing on the banks of the trees and thus
<div n="lb"/>falling in the rivers) for sending his daughters to their worthy
<div n="lb"/>husband.<sup>102</sup> Since the rivers emerged out from the mountain
<div n="lb"/>Raivataka, it may be called their father as described in verse
<div n="lb"/>28, but to avoid repetition the poet uses in verse 29 a synonym
<div n="lb"/>of its name viz., the Ūrjayat and while making it the symbal
<div n="lb"/>of father represents the sea as the husband of the rivers.<sup>103</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Thus the mountains Ūrjayat and the Raivataka are one and
<div n="lb"/>the same. We also get support for our suggestion from the
<div n="lb"/>fact that whereas the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradā-
<div n="lb"/>man describes the emergence of the rivers Palāśinī, Suvarṇsi-
<div n="lb"/>katā etc., from the mountain Ūrjayat<sup>104</sup> in Inscription No. 14
<div n="lb"/>the name of Raivataka is used in the same context.<sup>105</sup> Fleet<sup>106</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and Sircar<sup>107</sup> are wrong in describing Raivataka as a hill diff-
<div n="lb"/>erent from Ūrjayat or Girnar situated opposite to it. The
[Page-300+ 40]
<div n="lb"/>Vividhatīrthakalpa also uses the names Raivataka and the
<div n="lb"/>Ujjayant (Ūrjayat) as synonyms for Girinara which was sancti-
<div n="lb"/>fied by Śrīnemi and is situated in Surāṣṭra (South Kathia-
<div n="lb"/>wad).<sup>108</sup> In another inscription at Girnār (about 15th century)
<div n="lb"/>verses 5-8 refer to the mountain Girnār by both the names
<div n="lb"/>Ujjayanata and Raivata.<sup>109</sup> The Abhidhānacintāmaṇi of
<div n="lb"/>Hemacandra also mentions Ujjayanta and Raivataka as
<div n="lb"/>synonyms.<sup>110</sup> The Kap copper-plate of Keṭadi Sadāśiva-Nāyaka
<div n="lb"/>also refers to Ujjantagiri (Ūrjayat).<sup>111</sup> The mountain Ūrjayat
<div n="lb"/>is identified with Girnar hill near Junāgaṛh.<sup>112</sup> The literal
<div n="lb"/>meaning of Ūrjayat is strong, powerful, eminent.<sup>113</sup>

5. {%Viṣṇupada%}¦ (No. 20, L. 6):
<div n="P"/>We know from the inscription that a lofty standard of the
<div n="lb"/>divine Viṣṇu was set up on the hill called Viṣṇupada.<sup>114</sup> Liter-
<div n="lb"/>ally meaning ‘the hill marked with footprints of Viṣṇu’, Viṣṇu-
<div n="lb"/>pada hill has been identified with that part of the Delhi Ridge
<div n="lb"/>on which the column stands.<sup>115</sup> But there is no mountain in
<div n="lb"/>Delhi and the inscription appears to have been brought there
<div n="lb"/>from the mount Viṣṇupada.<sup>116</sup> On the evidence from the
<div n="lb"/>Epics, this Viṣṇupada hill is not far from Kurukshetra and the
<div n="lb"/>Beas.<sup>117</sup>

<P>We have seen from the Place-names discussed earlier that
<>they were named either after some hero, just as Gayā from
<>Gayāsura, Nepāla from the name of “Ne” ṛṣi, or after deities
<>just as Piṣṭapura, named after Piṣṭapurikā goddess. Other
<>examples are Indrapura named after God Indra, Devarāṣṭra
<>named after some unspecified god. Some places were named after
<>number, just as Koṭivarṣa, Pañcakulyavāpaka, Pañcanagarī. The
<>other category of place-names includes names derived either
<>from some natural surrounding just as Trivṛtā, having (good)
<>surroundings on the three sides; Vaṭodaka, surrounded by water;
<>Kṛmilā, full of kṛmis or insects; Tumbavana, abounding in
<>Tumba plants; or from the name of a tree just as Vaṭagohālī,
<>Palāśavṛndaka, Lavaṅgasikā (the clove tree); Eraṇḍapalla,
<>named after Eraṇḍa plant. In some cases the names point out
<>the geographical situation, just as Ādyapatha, Uttaramaṇḍala,
<>Dakṣiṇāpatha, Dakṣiṇāṃśaka-vīthi, Vindhyāṭavī, Goṣāṭa-
<>puñjaka, Airikiṇa, Saṃgohālikagrāma, Surāṣṭra, Kāñcī,
<>Doṅgā-grāma, Samataṭa.
<P>The place names were named after Tribes just as Puṇḍra-
<>vardhana named after the Puṇḍras; Vaṅga after Vaṅgas;
<>Āryāvarta after the Āryyas; Kākanādaboṭa after the Kākas;

<>Midu-vilāla-kṣetra, Jolārī-kṣetra, Mahipāla-kṣetra, Pakkavilāla-

<H>APPENDIX — I
<H>A NOTE ON THE KING CANDRA OF THE MEHARAULI
<>IRON PILLAR INSCRIPTION
<P>This iron pillar bearing the inscription of Candra was
<>originally erected on a hill called Viṣṇupada near the Beas,
<>but was brought to Meharaulī (Delhi) and was installed near
<>the well-known Kutub Minar.<sup>1</sup> We also know of the transfer
<>of the Aśokan pillars from Topra and Meerut to Delhi.<sup>2</sup>
<P>Though many scholars<sup>3</sup> have tried to identify Candra of
<>this inscription, it remains a baffling problem. The generally
<>accepted view is to identify him with Candragupta II.<sup>4</sup>
<P>Goyal<sup>5</sup> has identified Candra with Samudragupta. His
<>argument is that the original name of the king was not Candra
<>and in his support he quotes Fleet<sup>6</sup> and Allan. His second
<>contention is that whereas there is no evidence to prove that
<>Candragupta II had any military success in Bengal, we have a
<>positive reference in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription to
<>Samataṭa, Ḍavāka and Kāmarūpa as the bordering (pratyanta)
<>states of Samudragupta's empire. Goyal further argues that
<>Candragupta II had suzerainty over Daivaputraṣāhiṣāhānuṣāhis
<>who ruled in that region. He also points out that Samudra-
<>gupta had advanced victoriously to the south as far as Kāñcī
<>while Candragupta II can at best be credited with matrimonial
<>alliances or diplomatic activities alone in the South. Following
<>Majumdar, Mookerji and Agrawala he holds that Candrapra-
<>kāśa, son of Candragupta mentioned by the rhetorician Vāmana
<>was no other than Samudragupta and thus concludes that
<>Candra was another name of Samudragupta.
<P>We cannot accept Goyal's view since his arguments stand
<>on a weak edifice. We shall refute them one by one.
<P>Fleet<sup>7</sup> was mislead by the reading ‘Dhāvena’ in line 6
<>which seems to be ‘Bhāvena’ as suggested by some scholars.
[Page-310+ 39]
<>A perusal of the passage does not leave any doubt about Candra
<>being the original name of the king. Allan followed by Goyal<sup>8</sup>
<>describes it as a ‘poetical allusion’. But that does not mean
<>that the king had any name other than Candra. The poet
<>shows that his name was quite in consonance with his qual-
<>ities.<sup>9</sup> It is no doubt a poetic way of referring to his patron's
<>name. We have a similar instance in the Mandasor Inscription
<>of the Mālava Year 524 (A.D. 467). <sup>10</sup> Moreover, the reading in
<>line 6 of the inscription is clearly ‘Bhāvena’ and not Dhāvena.<sup>11</sup>
<P>We know that only a part of Bengal, i. e. Samataṭa was
<>conquered by Samudragupta; Davāka and Kāmarūpa being in
<>Assam, their subjugation does mean the occupation of the
<>whole of the Vaṅgas. Gupta inscriptions are recovered from
<>Puṇḍravardhana, Damodarpur and Rajshahi districts of Bengal
<>only after the reign of Candragupta II. Moreover, it seems that
<>the people of Samataṭa had revolted and were joined by other
<>neighbouring kings<sup>12</sup> and king Candra suppressed the revolt
<>with his force; eventually the whole of Vaṅga may have come
<>under his suzerainty.
<P>These considerations apart, palaeographically also the
<>inscription was considered by Fleet to be later than Samudra-
<>gupta. Prinsep placed it in the 3rd or 4th Century and Bhau
<>Daji in the post-Gupta period.<sup>13</sup> But Sircar assigns the record
<>to the 5th century on the basis of the resemblance of the
<>marked mātrās or horizontal top-strokes on the letters with
<>those used in the Bilsad Inscription of Kumāragupta I (A.D.
<>415-16).<sup>14</sup> This consideration is very important, but Goyal finds
<>it convenient not to consider it since it goes against his theory.
<P>Moreover, if king Candra of the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription
<>is to be identified with Samudragupta and if it is a posthumous
<>inscription, there could be a mention of the performance of
<>Aśvamedha sacrifice by him as is evidenced from his coins.
<P>It is further to be noted that in the Allahabad Pillar
<>Inscription there is no reference to the conquests of the Vāhli-
<>kas by samudragupta, though the neighbouring tribes of the
<>Daivaputras, Ṣāhis and Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and Muruṇḍas are
<>mentioned as paying homage to Samudragupta. On the con-
<>trary, king Candra is said to have conquered the Vāhlikas in
<>a warfare after crossing the seven mouths of the Sindhu.<sup>15</sup>
[Page-311+ 39]
<>M.R. Singh<sup>16</sup> and U.N. Roy,<sup>17</sup> however, identify the Vāhlika
<>in the Panjab and U.N. Roy goes further to identify the Vāhli-
<>kas with “Daivaputraṣāhi-ṣāhānuṣāhi” i. e. the Kidāra Kuṣāṇas.
<>But this seems contrary to the statement in the inscription
<>that king Chandra had conquered the Vāhlikas in warfare,
<>after having crossed the seven mouths of the river Indus.<sup>18</sup>
<P>So far as the conquests of king Candra in the South are
<>concerned we submit that it is an eulogy (praśasti) which may
<>be of the conventional type and may not be entirely historical.
<>The conventional claim is repeated by some later kings.<sup>19</sup> In
<>Line 5 of the Mandasor Stone Pillar Inscription we find that
<>Yaśodharman (A.D. 525-35) boasts to have conquered the
<>whole country to the west of the Paścima-payodhi and to the
<>north of the Mahendra (cf. Mahendrācala in the Tirunelveli
<>district).<sup>20</sup> We know that Candragupta II wielded a great influ-
<>ence in the south. His daughter Prabhāvatīguptā was married
<>to the Vākāṭaka king Rudrasena II. There is some evidence to
<>show that during the regency of Prabhāvatīguptā, Gupta officers
<>exercised some control over the Vākāṭaka administration.<sup>21</sup>
<>Further Candragupta II arranged a marriage between his son
<>and the daughter of Kākutsthavarman, the most powerful ruler
<>of the Kadamba family in the Kanarese country of the Bombay
<>Presidency.<sup>22</sup>.
<P>Goyal's assumption that Candra was another name of
<>Samudragupta is incorrect. We have criticised it earlier on
<>linguistic and palaeographic considerations. Moreovor, it looks
<>funny that the name of Candragupta I, his son and his grandson
<>alike should be the same. Utilising the evidence of Vāmana
<>that Vasubandhu was the minister of Candraprakāśa, the son of
<>Candragupta, Goyal quotes Majumdar<sup>23</sup> and takes Candragupta
<>to be Candragupta I and regards Candraprakāśa as another
<>name of Samudragupta. But Majumdar himself strikes a note
<>of caution when he says that “It is not altogether impossible
<>that Vasubandhu's patron belonged to this<sup>24</sup> or a similar
<>local dynasty of Ayodhyā”.<sup>25</sup> We cannot associate Vasubandhu
<>with the Imperial Guptas unless we find any strong evidence
<>of a positive nature.
<P>Thus we see that the arguments raised by Goyal do not
<>support his view that Samudragupta is to be identified with
[Page-312+ 43]
<>Candra. In the absence of any other positive evidence, to the
<>contrary, the theory of Candra's identification with Candra-
<>gupta II holds good.<sup>26</sup>

<H>APPENDIX-II
<>A NOTE ON THE NAME OF THE MOTHER OF
<>BUDHAGUPTA AND NARASIṂHAGUPTA
<P>In this connexion we have four inscriptions at our disposal:
<HI>(i) Nālandā Clay Seal of Narasiṃhagupta (No. 47)
<HI>(ii) Bhitari inscribed copper-silver Seal of Kumāragupta III
<>(No. 49).
<HI>(iii) Nālandā baked Clay Seal of Kumāragupta III (No. 50.)
<HI>(iv) Nālandā Clay seal of Budhagupta (No. 53).
<P>In No. 49. L. 6, Sircar<sup>1</sup> takes the reading Candradevī for
<>the mother of Narasiṃhagupta. It has been read as ‘Śrīvatsa-
<>devī’ by Fleet. It has been checked by me and the reading
<>taken by Fleet is found to be correct. The same reading is also
<>found in No. 50, L. 6.<sup>2</sup>
<P>In No. 47, L. 7, Candradvaī is found to be the name of
<>Narasiṃhagupta's mother. Hirananda Shastri reads the name
<>as ‘Śrīvainyadevī’ but he amends the reading as ‘Candradevī’.<sup>3</sup>
<>Sircar also accepts ‘Candradevī’ as the correct reading.<sup>4</sup>
<P>In No. 53 Candradevī is mentioned as the mother of Budha-
<>gupta.<sup>5</sup> But Sircar takes the reading ‘Śrī Mahādevī’ though
<>himself considers it to be doubtful.<sup>6</sup>
<P>Now we find that the inscriptions No. 49 and 50 mention
<>‘Śrīvatsadevī’ as the mother of Narasiṃhagupta while in No. 47
<>Candradevī is clearly the name of Narasiṃhagupta's mother. In
<>No. 53 ‘Candradevī’ is also mentioned as the name of Budha-
<>gupta's mother.
<P>These different readings have created a confusion about the
<>names of Budhagupta's and Narasiṃhagupta's mothers. In the
<>genealogical table Mookerji mentions ‘Candradevī’ as the
<>mother of both Budhagupta and Narasiṃhagupta.<sup>7</sup> Sircar
<>writes, “We cannot be sure about the name of Budhagupta's
<>mother; but she seems to be different from Candradevī, mother
[Page-315+ 17]
<>of Narasiṃhagupta”.<sup>8</sup> But the objection of Sircar is not valid,
<>as in the inscriptions No. 49 and 50 Śrīvatsadevī and not
<>Candradevī is mentioned as the mother of Narasiṃhagupta.
<P>The real difficulty is created by inscriptions No. 47 and 53
<>when they mention Candradevī as the mother of both Budha-
<>gupta and Narasiṃhagupta.

<H>APPENDIX-III
<>EXPLANATION OF THE PASSAGE “PAIṢṬAPURAKA-
<>MAHENDRAGIRI-KAUṬṬŪRAKA-SVĀMIDATTA”
<P>This expression occurs in L. 19 of the Allahabad Pillar
<>Inscription of Samudragupta. The compound expression has
<>been analysed in different ways by various scholars.
<P>Fleet splits it up as:
<P>Paiṣṭapuraka — Mahendragiri-Kauṭṭūraka — Svāmidatta<sup>1</sup> and
<>translates it as Mahendra of Piṣṭapura, Svāmidatta of Koṭṭūra
<>on the hill.<sup>2</sup>
<P>The first inclination of Fleet<sup>3</sup> is to analyse the expression
<>thus: ‘Paiṣṭapuraka-Mahendragiri-Kauṭṭūraka-Svāmidatta’ and
<>to translate it as ‘Mahendragiri of Piṣṭapura, and Svāmidatta
<>of Koṭṭūra’, but he does not stick to it finding difficulty in
<>accepting giri or gīr as suitable termination for a king's name,
<>thinking it only to be used as a religious title.<sup>4</sup>
<P>G. Ramdas<sup>5</sup> takes the whole phrase to be one and translates
<>it as ‘Svāmidatta, who had his seat at Piṣṭapura and at
<>Koṭṭūra near Mahendragiri’. This means that Svāmidatta was
<>the king of both the places. Ramdas supports it by the fact
<>that in inscriptions we often find the king of Piṣṭapura to have
<>been the king of Kaliṅga also in which Koṭṭūra is situated.
<>He also does not accept the name Mahendragiri as of a king, it
<>being unsupported by history or inscriptions. Bhau Daji<sup>6</sup>
<>gives another rendering ‘Svāmidatta of Piṣṭapura, Mahendra-
<>giri, and Koṭṭūra’. But the suggestions of Bhau Daji and
<>G. Ramdas are untenable, because in that case the reading in the
<>text, would have been ‘Māhendragirika’ in place of Mahendra-
<>giri.
<P>As regards the objection that the termination giri or gīr is
<>used only for Gosāvīs and not for kīngs, even in ancient India
<>we find people bearing such names as Himādri, Hemādri and
[Page-317+ 35]
<>Śeṣādri<sup>7</sup> as well as the name Siṃhagiri,<sup>8</sup> all based on terms
<>signifying mountain.
<P>As rightly pointed out by Bhandarkar,<sup>9</sup> in dividing the text,
<>the following two considerations are to be kept in view:
<HI>(i) None of the king's name is coupled with more than one
<>locality.
<HI>(ii) The name of every locality is marked with vṛddhi at the
<>beginning and with the suffix ‘ka’ at the end.
<P>Thus the only correct division of the text can be: —
<>Paiṣṭapuraka — Mahendragiri — Kauṭṭūraka — Svāmidatta’.<sup>10</sup> i. e.
<>Mahendragiri of Piṣṭapura and Svāmidatta of Koṭṭūra.

<>have had Gairikoṭṭūraka instead of giri-kauṭṭūrka. Secondly, it is not
<>necessary to take giri here as a denominational suffix similar to that of
<>giri or gīr of Gosāvīs, as Fleet has done. It is best to understand the whole
<>of Mahendragiri as one name and as the proper name of the ruler of Piṣṭa-
<>pura. If the names of the sacred rivers have been adopted as individual
<>names among Hindu females, the names of the sacred mountains have

<H>APPENDIX — IV
<>EXPLANATION OF THE EXPRESSION
<>“DAIVAPUTRAṢĀHIṢĀHĀNUṢĀHI”
<P>Scholars do not agree in their views about the explanation
<>of the expression ‘Daivaputraṣāhiṣāhānuṣāhi’ mentioned in line
<>23 of Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta. Daivapu-
<>tras along with Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas, and Muruṇḍas, and
<>the people of Siṃhala and all (other) islands are said to have
<>acknowledged the suzerainty of Samudragupta by rendering to
<>him all kind of service (sevā) such as coming to the emperor
<>personally (ātmanivedana) gifts of maidens (Kanyopāyana),
<>presents (dāna) and application (yācanā) for charters bearing
<>the Imperial Gupta Garuḍa seal (Garutmadaṅka) by which
<>they would not be disturbed in the enjoyment (bhukti) and
<>administration (śāsana) of their respective territories (svaviṣaya).<sup>1</sup>
<P>Fleet, V.A. Smith and Allan split ‘daivaputra-ṣāhi-ṣāhānu-
<>ṣāhi’ into three different titles denoting three different princes,<sup>2</sup>
<>who might have been rulers of three smaller states into which
<>the Kuṣāṇa empire was divided, each one of them appropriat-
<>ing one of the titles for himself.<sup>3</sup> But Majumdar,<sup>4</sup> Bhandarkar,<sup>5</sup>
<>Sircar<sup>6</sup> and Raychaudhuri<sup>7</sup> take ‘Daivaputra-ṣāhi-ṣāhānuṣāhi’
<>to indicate one Kuṣāṇa ruler.
<P>Goyal<sup>8</sup> raises the objection that there was no Kuṣāṇa ruler
<>so powerful in the third quarter of the fourth century A.D., to
<>whom could be attributed such a great title as ‘daivaputraṣāhi-
<>ṣāhānuṣāhi’. He divides the whole expression into two parts
<>‘daivaputraṣāhi’ and ‘ṣāhānuṣāhi’ to denote two powers.
<>According to him, the former is to be identified with the
<>Kidāra Kuṣāṇa king and the latter with Shāhpur II, the Sas-
<>sanian śāhānśāh. His contention is that the word Devaputra
<>has not been used as a title, its taddhita form shows that it is
<>an adjective to the next word ṣāhi.
[Page-319+ 39]
<P>Buddha Prakash<sup>9</sup> gives new suggestion that the whole ex-
<>pression ‘daivaputraṣāhiṣāhānuṣāhi’ denotes a Persian king.
<>His assertion is that the Kuṣāṇas had lost their importance and
<>independence by that time by allying themselves with the
<>Persians; this is clear from Kālidāsa, who in referring to the
<>North-Western conquests of Raghu, does not mention the
<>Śakas but refers only to the Persians.<sup>10</sup> Moreover, in the Kuṣāṇa
<>records Ṣāhānuṣāhi has never been used as the imperial title of
<>the Kuṣāṇas and has been a title exclusively employed by the
<>Sassanian sovereigns. He thus takes ‘devaputra’ to stand for the
<>Kuṣāṇa king of the Indus valley and Kasmeremaṇḍala and
<>Ṣāhānuṣāhi for the Sassanian emperor Shāhpur II (A.D. 309-379)
<>and concludes that, the mention of ‘devaputraṣāhānuṣāhi’ to-
<>gether suggests an alliance of the Kuṣāṇas with the Sassanians,
<>cemented by the marriage between the Kuṣāṇa princes and
<>Hormizd II (A.D. 302-309).<sup>11</sup>
<P>The contention of Dr. Buddha Prakash is unacceptable. He
<>neglects the word ‘Ṣāhi’ occurring between Daivaputra and
<>Ṣāhānuṣāhi. Moreover, he takes into his account the word
<>‘Devaputra’ but does not consider the form of Daivaputra.<sup>12</sup> It
<>may be noted that the word ‘Shāhi’ has been indiscriminately
<>used by the Kuṣāṇas, the Hūṇas and by the kings of Kabul,
<>Turks as well as Hindu kings of the brāhmaṇa clan.<sup>13</sup>
<P>The suggestion of Goyal may likewise be dismissed. In
<>interpreting the expression we have to keep in our view the
<>following considerations:
<HI>(i) It is to be noted that ‘Daivaputra’ in itself is an independ-
<>ent word and its taddhita form denotes those ‘who belong
<>to Devaputra’, i. e. Kaniṣka<sup>14</sup> (The Kuṣāṇas used Devaputra
<>as their title).
<HI>(ii) Ṣāhi stands for the Persians or a sub-branch of the Kuṣā-
<>ṇas;<sup>15</sup> and
<HI>(iii) Ṣāhānuṣāhi for the Sassanians.
<>Moreover, the context does not suggest any particular referen-
<>ce to any king by name. Here we have an enumeration of tribes,
<>viz., the Daivaputras, the Ṣāhis, the Ṣāhānuṣāhis, the Śakas
<>and the Muruṇḍas.<sup>16</sup>
<P>From the Jain legend {%Kālakācāryakathānaka%} we know:
<>“The Śaka king who lived on the other side of the Indus used
[Page-320+ 40]
<>the title Ṣāhānuṣāhi, while his feudatorles were simply styled
<>Ṣāhis”<sup>17</sup> Chattopadhyaya states that the Śakas never used the
<>title of Ṣāhānuṣāhi which was mainly a Kuṣāṇa title. Whatever,
<>may be the truth, but it supports our assertion that the Ṣāhis
<>and the Ṣāhānuṣāhis were two separate entities and not one.

<H>APPENDIX-V
<>THE RIVERS OF JUNĀGAṚH
<P>The names of the rivers, mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Inscrip-
<>tion of Skandagupta, as issuing from the mountain Raivataka<sup>1</sup>
<>or Ūrjayat<sup>2</sup> have been disputed. Fleet explains ‘Palāśinīyam
<>Sikatāvilāsinī’ as ‘Palāśinī, beautiful with (its) sandy stretches’.<sup>3</sup>
<>D.C. Sircar takes Sikatā to be Suvarṇasikatā which is the same
<>as modern Soṇarekhā.<sup>4</sup> R.B. Pandey regards Sikatā to be the
<>same Suvarṇasikatā mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Inscription of
<>Rudradāman and as identical with Suvarṇarekhā which flows
<>at the foot of Girnar hill.<sup>5</sup> H.D. Sankalia while discussing the
<>names of mountains Girinagara, Ūrjayat and Raivataka, and
<>the rivers at Junāgaṛh does not consider these disputed lines of
<>the Junāgaṛh Inscription of Skandagupta. He only discusses
<>Suvarṇasikatā and Palāśinī on the basis of the Junāgaṛh In-
<>scription of Rudradāman I<sup>6</sup>.
<P>Those who disagree with Fleet's interpretation that ‘Sikatā-
<>vilāsinī’ is an adjective of Palāśinī and take Sikatā to refer to
<>Suvarṇasikatā, neglect the word Vilāsinī. Evidently Vilāsinī is
<>the name of a third river. The construction is also in plural. The
<>composer of the inscription is naming all the rivers of the area
<>which had gone to meet their husband, the ocean, in due accord-
<>ance with the scriptures.<sup>7</sup> The Gujarati Sanskrit poet Māgha,
<>in describing the Raivataka mountain gives a similar account
<>of these rivers in the rainy season.<sup>8</sup>
<P>In the accompanying map besides the two rivers Ojat and
<>Uben on the sides of Jūnāgaṛh, we find the river Fuljar and a
<>number of streams, viz., Nonpuria, Sonrakhi, Lotus and Fuljar.
<>Sonrakhi is evidently Suvarṇarekhā, Fuljar may be the river
<>Palāśinī and the Lotus may be equated with Vilāsinī. The
<>river Ojat has some resemblance with the mountain Ūrjayat.
<P>The rivers due to the flood caused by excessive rains had
[Page-322+ 1]
<Picture>
[Page-323+ 35]
<>combined into one; with the flowers fallen from trees growing
<>on the banks of these rivers, it looked as if a hand decorated
<>with flowers was stretched by the mountain Raivataka desirous
<>of appropriating the wives of the mighty ocean, having noticed
<>the great bewilderment of the Sea caused by the excess of rain.<sup>9</sup>
<>Fleet's rendering of the passage<sup>10</sup> does not seem to be appro-
<>priate. The line ‘aneka-tīrāntaja-puṣpa-śobhito nadīmayo hasta
<>iva prasāritaḥ’ shows that here is a reference to a group of many
<>rivers and not to one river alone.
